As we have predicted, where Phalech and Japheth were, in the time of Phalech, the confusion of language occurred during the construction of the tower of Babel, Genesis 11. Therefore, the nations are divided into three parts throughout the world. If the depicted figure is inspected with tenacious consideration, it will become clear in which region of the world each part is situated, as we will evidently show in the following sections, proceeding first through the regions of Asia, then Africa, and Europe, which we will describe in alphabetical order so that the diligent reader may be able to grasp with tenacious memory the distances and connections of kingdoms and regions. Without knowledge of these, judgments are made about the truth of sacred history in canonical books, with the blindness of color, as John 3 says: "If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how then will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?" That is, if you are not able to grasp earthly things, how will you comprehend heavenly things? Therefore, how much labor they endured in exploring the provinces of the earth, what dangers of the sea they suffered, and what great expenses they incurred, will become clear from my letter to the priest Paulinus, chapter one. Therefore, one must not turn a deaf ear to what is expedient and fitting for all. However, the present work, I hope, was not fully capable of containing all the names of lands, kingdoms, and regions due to the narrowness of the page. Therefore, the diligent reader, having noted the name of the region, should immediately refer to the following, collected with laborious effort from Isidore, Pliny, Herodotus, and the gloss of sacred history, according to the alphabet. Note also that if the desired information is not found in one word, look for it under its synonym. For Chaldea, Babylon, and Shinar are almost the same; Sicyon, Arcadia, Hungary, Pannonia; Lacedaemon and Sparta; Sweden, Gothia, and so on for each. With these well noted, it will be easy to comprehend in memory every land and province in the text of the Bible and the legends of the saints. And to be led, as it were, through an orbit into the knowledge of these, as Prosper says in the one hundred and sixth chapter.

The orb is said to be from the wheel and is any spherical and round figure. And therefore the world is called an orb because it is round and is sometimes combined with earth or lands and is called orbisterr or orbisterrae. And according to Isidore, in book 15 of the Etymologies, it is divided into three parts. One part is Asia, another Europe, and the third is called Africa. The ancients divided these three parts of the world unequally. Asia extends from the meridian through the east to the north. Europe, however, reaches from the north to the west. But Africa extends from the west to the meridian. Asia alone contains one part of our habitable world, namely half; the other parts, namely Africa and Europe, have obtained the other half. Between these parts, the great sea proceeds from the ocean and intersects them. Therefore, if you divide the order into two parts, east and west, Asia is in one, and Africa and Europe are in the other. Thus, the sons of Noah divided after the flood, among whom Shem with his power possessed Asia, Japheth Europe, and Ham Africa, as the gloss says on Genesis 10 and on the first book of Paralipomenon. Chrysostom, Isidore, and Pliny say the same.

About Asia
Asia, therefore, which is believed to be the middle part of the orb, is named after a certain woman who held the kingdom of the east among the ancients, as Isidore says in book 15. This, situated in the third part of the orb, has the rising of the sun from the east, the ocean from the meridian, our sea from the west, and is bounded by the Maeotian Lake and the Thanais River from the north. It has many provinces and regions and diverse nations of peoples, admirable in life and in morals, differing remarkably in the shapes of their bodies as well as in the affections of their minds, whose names and locations we will briefly set forth here, following the alphabetical order.

About Assyria.
Assyria is a region and province of Asia, so called from Assur, the son of Shem, who first inhabited and cultivated that region after the flood. It has India from the east, touches the Mediterranean from the meridian, has the Tigris from the west, and the Caucasus Mountains from the north, where the Caspian Gates are, as Isidore says in book 15. In this region, the use of purple was first discovered. From there also came the first perfumes and body ointments, as well as fragrances, from which Roman luxury and Greek extravagance flowed, as Isidore says. And it is the most temperate land in temperate regions, but in many extremities, due to the disturbances of the earth's masses, just as in beasts and serpents, so also in the morals of men it is mostly restless, as Pliny says in book 3, where he describes the cruelties of men. In this province dwell the Assyrians, named after Assur, a most powerful people from ancient times, who held the region from the Euphrates to the borders of the Indian Ocean in the middle of the earth, as Isidore says in book 9.

About Arabia.
Arabia is a sacred province, also called Thurifera, as Isidore says in book 15, for there especially abound frankincense trees and other fragrant trees. Because of the sacred fragrance of these aromatics, the Greeks called it Eudaimon, and the Latins called it Blessed, as the same author says in the same place. For in these groves grow myrrh and ebony, and other medicinal plants especially thrive. There grows the phoenix bird and a diverse and vain multitude of other forest creatures, both beasts and birds. In Arabia, there is also a diversity of gems, as Isidore, Pliny, and Orosius say. There is duplex sardonyx and the gem iris, indeed a multiple number of gems is found. There dragons are found, and certain asps in whose bodies the preciousness of diverse gems is found. In it is Saba, so named from the son of Cush, and it is a part of the land of Arabia, the southernmost part of the Persian Sea, narrowed and consumed towards the Arabian Gulf. About Saba, inquire below.

About Armenia
Armenia is named after Armenus, the Thessalian companion of Jason, who, after the loss of King Jason, gathered a multitude of those who wandered about and seized Armenia, and named it from his own name, as Isidore says in book 15. This is the land of Ararat, to which the sons of Sem fled after they killed him while he was praying in the temple of his god, as the history of the fourth book of Kings relates. And Ararat is said to be the mountain on which Noah's ark rested after the flood. This Armenia lies between Mount Taurus and the Caucasus, extending from Cappadocia to the Caspian Sea, having the Ceraunian Mountains from the north, from which the Tigris River springs, as Isidore, Pliny, and Crispus say in the same place. There are two Armenias, namely Upper and Lower, just as there are two Pannonia, in each of which certain wonderful and monstrous things are often found in our opinion. The land in Armenia, where it touches the shores of the Tigris or Euphrates, is most pleasant with herbs and fruits, groves and orchards, but it is filled with many kinds of cruel beasts and serpents, as the same author says. And Pliny narrates much about this in book 2.

About Albania
Albania is a province of greater Asia, named from the color of its people, because they are born with white hair. For it is a cold region compared to the other regions that are said to belong to Asia. This Albania has the Caspian Sea from the east and rises through the shores of the northern ocean to the Maeotian marshes and desolate, uncultivated places, extending itself. This land has huge dogs, both in size and body, so fierce that they press bulls, subdue lions, and, lifting up the strongest of beasts, overcome and prostrate them, as Pliny exemplifies with the Albanian dog, which, sent to Alexander, triumphed over a lion, a boar, and an elephant in the stadium, as the same author says in book 7, chapter 1. The people of Cambus Albania here have painted and bluish eyes in the pupil, so that they see better at night than during the day, as the same author says in the same place, book 9. Solinus also narrates the same as a marvel.

About the Amazons
Amazonia is a region partly in Asia and partly in Europe, which is near Albania and is named after the Amazons. The Amazons were Goths who came out of the inferior Syrtis of the Oxus, as Isidore says in book 9, who, after their husbands were killed by treachery, taking up the arms of their husbands, bravely attacked their male enemies and exacted due vengeance from their own hands. For they killed every male from old to young with the sword, and keeping the women and plundering the spoils of the enemy, they decreed to live together without the company of males. They appointed two queens over themselves, namely Marpesia and Lampeto, following the example of the Mantians, who always used to have two kings. One of them, proceeding with the army, fought against the enemies, while the other governed the republic in the meantime. They became so strong and warlike in a short time that they subjected a large part of Asia to their dominion. Among themselves, they did not allow any male to live or remain for any reason, but they chose men from neighboring peoples for the sake of offspring. Approaching them at fixed times, they conceived children. But when the time for conception was completed, the men returned to their own places, and they either killed the males or sent them back to their fathers at the right time, but they kept the daughters for themselves, training them to shoot arrows and hunt. And so that they would not be hindered in the shooting of arrows by the thickness of their breasts, they burned off their breasts in the seventh year, as it is said. And therefore they are called Amazons, that is, without breasts, as Isidore says in book 9. Many anciently called these women Unimammae. Hercules, as it is said, first subdued one of them, then Achilles. But this was rather through cunning than through strength, as is contained in the deeds of the Greeks and Amazons. But the same author says that the Amazons were completely destroyed by Alexander the Great to the point of annihilation. But the history of Alexander does not say this; rather, it is said that the queen of the Amazons, when Alexander asked for tribute through messengers, wrote back: "It is astonishing of your prudence that you have started a war with women. Consider, if fortune favors us, and it befalls you to succumb, how confused you will be when you are defeated by women. But if the gods do not allow us to defeat you, it is little honor for you to yield, since you have triumphed over mere women." Upon hearing this response, the king, moved to admiration, said that it was fitting not to conquer women by the sword and fury, but rather by love, wherefore he granted them liberty and did not violate them, but rather subjugated them to his rule by cunning.

About Babylon.
Babylon is a province of Asia in Chaldea, whose capital is the city of Babylon, from which the region is named, so noble that the names Chaldea, Assyria, and Mesopotamia have sometimes passed over to it, as the same author says in book 15. Most noble rivers flow through it, among which the chief are the Tigris and Euphrates, which have their source in Paradise. It is a region most fertile in all fruits and produce, rich in wild animals and aromatic trees, herbs, and abundant in gems and metals, camels, horses, asses, mules, and other beasts of burden. It abounds in strange and wonderful beasts, especially in the deserts. Its metropolis was once called Babylon, that is, confusion, because there the language of those building the tower of Babel was confused, as Genesis 11 says, whose magnitude Jerome describes in his commentary on Isaiah 11. Babylon, he says, is the metropolis of the Chaldeans, sixteen thousand paces in a square from angle to angle, which is sixty-four miles in total. From there, it extended two leagues and two-thirds of a league, and there was a tower of three thousand paces in height, that is, two leagues, narrowed from wide to narrow, whose material was baked bricks made of indissoluble bitumen, so that it could not be dissolved by fire or water. And because the language was confused there, it is called Babel in Hebrew, but Babylon in Greek, which entire region around Babylon is called. This was ruled by a most powerful king, namely Nebuchadnezzar, who, among the other nations of the world that he subjected to the Chaldean empire, also took Judea captive, wherefore Babylon, under his grandson Belshazzar, was completely destroyed by Cyrus and Darius, kings of the Persians and Medes, and never rebuilt. But from its remains, namely Sophon Therosophon, were built in Persia, as Jerome says. The place, however, where Babylon once was is deserted and contains nothing but monstrous beasts. Inquire below about Chaldea.

About Bactria
Bactria is a region in Asia, from which a river named Bactrus takes its name, as Isidore says in book 15. Its parts that are flat are surrounded in part by India, while those that are opposite are bounded by the Indus River. The remaining part is watered by the Ochus River. Bactria sends forth very strong camels, which trample down their feet, as Isidore says.

About Bithynia.
Bithynia, as Isidore says, is a province of Asia Minor, situated in Pontus, facing away from the east towards the part of the south, adjacent to Troy, previously named by many names. First, it was called Lithicia, then it was soon named Bithynia after King Bithynus. It is larger than Phrygia, whose metropolis is called Nicomedia, where Hannibal, the prince of Carthage, fleeing, breathed out his soul by poison, as Isidore says in book 15. But Bithynia was first founded by Phoenicia, which was previously called Miramunda, as the same author says.

About Cappadocia.
Cappadocia is a province in Asia Minor, located at the head, touching Armenia from the east, Asia Minor from the west, the plains that the Amazons once had from the north, and the Tauric Mountain from the meridian, under which lies Cilicia and Isaura, as far as the Cilician Gulf, which faces the island of Cyprus. The Albis River flows abundantly through it, which once divided the kingdoms of Lydia from Persia, as Isidore says in book 15 and Orosius in book 1. From here first came Amosoch and Saphet, whence also a city remains among them to this day, called Moreta, as Isidore says in book 9.

About Chaldea.
Chaldea, as if Cassida, was named from Caseph, the son of Nachor, the brother of Abraham, as the same author says. Hence the Chaldeans are called from Casseth, as if Cassidei. And it is a very large region situated next to the Euphrates, in which is the plain of Dura, where the giants convened after the flood, and by their common counsel Nimrod built the tower of Babel, from which the city built there was called Babylon, and the entire region was named Babylon in the future, as is evident above in the letter B about Babylon. But here it must be said what Orosius says about Babylon in book 2. "The first king among the Assyrians," he says, "who was more eminent than the others, was Ninus. After Ninus was killed, Semiramis, his wife, the queen of all Asia, enlarged and restored the city of Babylon, which Nimrod had begun, and established it as the capital of the kingdom of the Assyrians." That kingdom lasted and stood unshaken for 1264 years until Sardanapalus, whom Arbates, the prefect of the Medes, killed. Then the kingdom of the Assyrians began to perish, but it was completely destroyed by Cyrus and Darius, so that it could scarcely be believed by mortals that so strong a city could be captured. For it was arranged in a square with equal sides in the manner of camps, and the magnitude and firmness of its walls can scarcely be believed. For in width, the walls had 50 cubits, and in height, they had four times as much. The circumference was 480 stadia, and the wall was built of baked brick, compacted with bitumen. A wide ditch lay outside, in which the river flowed around the front of the walls. There were 100 gates in the circuit of the walls. There were dwellings for defenders equally arranged, of wonderful magnitude and strength. And although it was so strong, it was quickly conquered, captured, and overthrown. For Ninus divided the river into 360 channels, just as he had done before with the Ganges River, when, angry against the river because it had submerged one of his soldiers, he divided it into 360 parts. Thus, the water that flowed through the city was drawn off, and it was more easily captured, as Orosius says in the same place. In that year in which Babylon began to be destroyed by Arbates, Rome began to be founded. Hence, under one coincidence of time, that one fell, and this one rose, and when the first kingdom of the East failed, the kingdom of the West began to flourish.

About Kedar
Kedar is the name of the region in which the Ishmaelites dwell, who were the sons of Kedar, the firstborn of Ishmael. For Ishmael was the son of Abraham by Hagar, his Egyptian handmaid. They are falsely called Agarenes or Saracens, who boast that they are sprung from Sarah, as the same author says in book 9. These do not build houses, but like wild men, wandering through desolate places for pastures, they dwell in tents, acquiring food from plunder and hunting. And therefore Ishmael was called Onager, as the gloss says on Genesis 16. For he was a wild man, and all the beasts surpassed him in wildness and were tamed by him, as Methodius says, foretelling that at the end, gathered together, they will come out of the deserts and occupy the orb of the earth for eight weeks of years. And their way is called the way of anguish, for they will subvert cities and kingdoms in sacred places. They will kill priests, sleep with women there, drink from sacred vessels, and tie beasts to the tombs of saints because of the wickedness of the Christians who then exist. These and many other things he recounts that the inhabitants of Kedar, the Ishmaelites, will do in the world.

About Canaan
Canaan is a region in Phoenicia, which was possessed by the sons of Canaan, the son of Ham, after the flood, and there were ten nations from them, as the same author says in book 9. From these were seven nations of the seed of Canaan, in whom the curse of Ham was rooted as if by hereditary right, and therefore they were destroyed by the sons of Israel by divine command, and their lands were occupied by them, as Isidore says in book 9.

About Cilicia.
Cilicia is a province of Asia Minor, named from a certain ancient son of Jupiter, as they assert, as the same author says in book 15. It has Pamphylia from the west, the Cilician Sea from the south, and the ridges of the Taurus Mountains from the east and north. The Cydnus River abundantly intersects it, having its source near Vibius of Tarsus, whose mother is also called Tharsis. Paul was from Tarsus, a city of Cilicia, where saffron, most abundant and excellent, is found, surpassing gold in fragrance and color, as Isidore says in book 15.

About Havilah.
Havilah is a province in upper India, beginning from the east and spreading towards the north in a long tract of land. It is said to be named Havilah from the son of Heber, the patriarch of the Hebrews, as the gloss says on Genesis 10, where it is said that among the sons of Heber, Joktan is named Havilah. The Ganges River flows through this region, which is called Pishon by another name in the book of Genesis, which Pliny greatly extols with praises in book 6, chapter 20, where he says that the Indian Ganges River receives many or rather countless rivers and navigable streams, such as the Hydaspes, Cantabria, Isapus, and many others, and is never wider than forty stadia or deeper or higher than fifteen paces. This river encircles the land of Havilah, in which gold and aromatic spices abound, such as bdellium and precious gems such as onyx and carbuncle and the like, as the same author says and the gloss on Genesis. In this land, there are many partial regions, in which a multitude of elephants is especially said to abound.

About Phrygia
Phrygia is a province of Asia Minor, so called from Phrygia, the daughter of Europa, bordering Galatia from the north, Lydia from the south, and Mysia from the east. It is bounded by the Hellespont from the north, as Isidore says in book 15. There are two Phrygias, Major, which has Smyrna, and Minor, which has Ilium. The river of the province divides maritime Phrygia, as the same author says. Phrygia, however, was called Dardania from Dardanus, who, setting out from Greece with his brother Thracius, occupied Phrygia and, reigning there, named Phrygia Dardania from his name. His brother, however, occupied Thrace, as the same author says in book 9.

About Galilee.
Galilee is a region of Palestine, so called because the men are whiter than the Palestinians. This is twofold, namely Upper and Lower, and they are contiguous to each other and connected, adhering closely. It is a fertile and excellent land, very rich and fruitful in grains, fruits, vines, and olives. It is watered by the Jordan River in some part of it. It has noble and very large lakes, useful and healthful, which, because of their magnitude and multitude of fish, are called seas. There is, as Isidore says, Lake Tiberias, so called from the town of Tiberias, and it is a lake more healthful for the health of the body than all others, having 10 stadia. Inquire above about Lake Tiberias and Lake Gennesaret in the treatise on waters and ponds.

About India

India, east of Rdia, is a region named after the Indus River, which encloses it on the western side. It extends from the meridian eastward to the sunrise and northward to the Caucasus Mountains, encompassing many peoples and towns, as well as the island of Taprobane, abundant in gems and elephants. It also has the islands of Argyre and Aurea, rich in gold and silver, and fertile. There are also forests with trees whose leaves never fall. India also has the most noble rivers, the Ganges and the Indus, and the Hypanis, illuminating the Indian regions. India is very healthy with a favorable wind; it produces crops twice a year. It also produces colored cloths, men, elephants, monkeys, the unicorn beast, the psittacus bird, ebony wood, cinnamon, pepper, and aromatic calamus. It also yields ivory and precious stones: beryls, chrysoprase, carbuncles, diamonds, pearls, and unions, with which the ambition of noble women burns. There are also golden mountains, which it is impossible to reach because of dragons and griffins and all kinds of human monsters, as Ysidore says, whose words are all the aforementioned, as is clear in book 15. Moreover, India is the largest, wealthiest, most powerful, and most populous of all the regions of the world. Pliny recounts wonders about India's multitude and power in book 6, chapter 19. He says that there are many kings in India, some of whom have 94,000 armed men, and others have 600,000 cavalry and 9,000 elephants, who are paid daily. Hence, there is a great conjecture of many riches. Others have 9,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, and 700 elephants, and all these are prepared for the onset of war. Hence, it is clear that the land is powerful and wealthy. Whence, as it is said there, some in India cultivate the land, others engage in warfare. Some transport their merchandise, others govern and rule the republic very well. Some sit on thrones, others render judgments, some especially devote themselves to religious matters and attend to the discipline of wisdom. And since it is vaster and larger than all regions, it is more wonderful in all things. For as Pliny says in book 8, chapter 3, India, he says, abounds in miracles in a long stretch towards Ethiopia. For in India are born the largest animals and dogs larger than others; trees of such great height are said to grow there that they cannot be surpassed by arrows. But this is due to the fertility of the soil, the temperature of the sky, and the abundance of water. The fig tree there extends so much that many troops of soldiers can recline under the shade of one. Reeds also there are of such great height that single internodes sometimes carry three men in a navigable trough. Moreover, there are men of great stature there, exceeding five cubits in height, who are not afflicted by sneezing, nor by headache, nor by toothache, nor by eye ailments, nor are their bodies harmed by immoderate heat of the sun, but rather they are hardened. Moreover, their philosophers, whom they call gymnosophists, stand from sunrise until sunset in the hottest sands, gazing at the sun with immovable eyes. In those mountains also are men who have reversed soles and eight toes on their feet. There are also dog-headed men there who are clothed in wild animal skins; however, they bark like dogs and do not speak at all. They live by hunting and fowling; they are armed with claws and teeth. They are very numerous, more than 120,000, as it says there. There are also women in a certain tribe of India who never give birth more than once, and immediately turn gray. There are also other monstrous men there, about whom Baruch speaks in the treatise on monstrous animals. There are also certain men at the end of eastern India, near the source of the Ganges, without mouths, clothed in the down of leaves, who live only on the odor of apples; they do not eat or drink anything, but only attract the odor of flowers and wild apples with their noses, and thence they live; they die quickly in a bad odor. There are also others who live very long and never grow old, but die as if in middle age. There are also those who turn gray in youth and enter old age. Pliny recounts these and many other wonders about Hyrcania.

About Hyrcania

Hyrcania is a region in Asia situated under the ridges of the Caucasus Mountains. It is indeed a very wide region, having many peoples differing in language and customs, as Ysidore says in book 15. Orosius also says that it extends from the Caucasus Mountains into Scythia, having 44 peoples, who, because of the infertility of the land, wander far and wide, some of whom inhabit fields, some live by hunting, but some, truly cruel and bestial monsters, live on human flesh and drink their own blood, as Ysidore says in book 15, where he adds that Hyrcania is named after the Hyrcanian forest, which lies beneath Scythia, having the Caspian Sea to the east, Greater Armenia to the south, Albania to the north, and Hybernia to the west. It is a wild region, abundant in bears, lions, leopards, tigers, and panthers. It also produces birds that are called Hyrcanian, whose feathers shine at night; and such birds are also found in Germany, as Ysidore says in the same place. John Hyrcanus, the son of Simon the high priest, conquered these Hyrcanian peoples in the time of the Maccabees, after whose conquest John was named Hyrcanus, as the master says in the beginning of the evangelical history. Jerome says the same.

About Idumea

Idumea is a region from Arabia named after Edom, that is, Esau, the son of Isaac. For the sons of Esau, who was called Edom, drove out the Horites and inhabited that land, and they called that land Idumea, that is, the land of the sons of Edom, from themselves. Moreover, Idumea is separated from Palestine by certain deserts, whose borders extend to the Red Sea. Moreover, it is a strong and mountainous land situated under the fierce heat of the sun; and therefore the inhabitants of the land make subterranean houses and caves for themselves against the heat of the sun, as the gloss says above Obadiah.

About Judea

Judea is a region in Palestine named after Judah, from whose tribe it had kings. This was previously called Canaan, from the son of Ham, or from the ten tribes of the Canaanites, whom the Jews drove out and possessed that land. Its length extends from the town of Arpha to the town of Juliacen, in which there is a common habitation of Jews and Tyrians; its width, however, extends from Mount Lebanon to Lake Tiberias. In the middle of Judea is the city of Jerusalem, as it were the navel of the whole region. The land is rich in various resources, fertile in grains and fruits, illustrious with rivers and waters, excellent in balsams, abundant in metals, cedars, palms, cypresses, and distinguished by other most noble trees, full of vineyards, pomegranates, and olives, a land of milk and honey. Whence, because of the grace of the elements, the Jews thought that land promised to their fathers to be flowing with milk and honey, since it promised them the glory of the resurrection, as Ysidore says in book 15. Pliny says of this in book 5, chapter 12: Judea is a part without which it spreads far and wide, which is close to Egypt and Arabia, dispersed in rough customs, which the Jordan River flows through and divides and distinguishes Galilee from the other Jews. In Judea, however, is the city of Jerusalem, the most famous city of the eastern world. Judea, however, has hot and healthy springs; it also has at the end the Dead Sea, which is called Lake Asphaltites. It is so called because it produces nothing living except bitumen, in which nothing lives. But if anything living is thrown in, it floats. The Jordan River drinks from this lake and loses its praised waters mixed with pestilential waters.

About Hybernia

Hybernia is a region in Asia joined to Pontus near Armenia. In this region grow herbs that are useful for dyeing, as Ysidore says.

About Lectonia

Lectonia is a province of Scythia whose people, the Lectimi, are strong and brave, warlike and fierce men. Moreover, Lectonia is a region whose soil is fruitful, marshy in many places, and very wooded, irrigated by rivers and waters, very full of hay and livestock, fortified by forests and swamps, having few other mountains, except for rivers, forests, and swamps; and therefore that region cannot be conquered in the summer. But only in winter, because the waters and rivers freeze.

About Lycaonia

Lycaonia is a gulf of the sea, and the major city is called Lystra, from which one sails through the sea of Syna Pamphylia to Italy, as is clear in Acts 27. Moreover, this region is truly called Lycaonia, whose cities are said to have been Lystra and Derbe, to which Paul and Barnabas fled from Iconium, where, after healing a man in Lystra, the Lycaonians called Barnabas Jove and Paul Mercury, and they wanted to worship them, as it is said in Acts 14.

About Mesopotamia

Mesopotamia possesses a Greek etymology because it is surrounded by two rivers. It has the Tigris to the east and the Euphrates to the west. It begins in the north between Mount Taurus and the Caucasus, which is followed by Babylon and Chaldea to the south, as Ysidore says in book 9, chapter 5. Moreover, it is a very large region in Asia, both in width and in length, abounding in fruits, pastures, livestock, and rich in rivers and metals.

About Nabataea

Nabataea is a province of Arabia named after Nabaioth, the son of Ishmael, and it is a region between Syria and Judea. Moreover, it rises from the Euphrates and extends to the Red Sea, as Ysidore says in book 15. Moreover, it is a very rich and fertile land in fruits, produce, livestock, precious stones, and metals. Pliny says of this in book 6, chapter 29: The Nabataeans inhabit a town situated in a valley, having almost two miles in width, surrounded by inaccessible mountains, with a flowing stream, and it is distant from the town of Gaza six hundred paces from the Persian Gulf, 131.

About Ophir

Ophir is the name of a province in India, from Ophir, a man of the descendants of Heber, and named after him, which was also called Aurea Antiquitus because it has golden mountains that are inhabited by lions and very fierce beasts, to which no one else dares to approach, unless the ship is standing near the shore of the land, which they find dug up by the claws of lions and other beasts, and they receive it into their ship; if the beasts sense them, they are easily received into the ship, as Rabanus says on that place. When Solomon's ships came to Ophir, they took gold from there, 3 Kings 9, 28; 2 Chronicles 8, 18. Pliny says almost the same. Formerly, this province had gold, precious stones, chrysoprase, and diamonds, thymi wood and ebony, psittacus birds and peacocks, ivory teeth, apes, and other monstrous beasts, as Pliny and Ysidore say. To this region, however, one travels from Judea through long and rough detours and through the island of Taprobane, which Alexander the Great later leveled to the ground; one passes through Ophir. Moreover, the inhabitants of the land of Ophir, coming from the stock of Heber, from the Capua River to the region of India, which is now called Regia, inhabited, as Josephus relates, and they called the entire province Ophir after Ophir, the grandson of Heber, as Rabanus says on 2 Chronicles 7, 18. Moreover, this Ophir was the son of Joktan, the son of Heber, as is clear in Genesis 10. Moreover, this is the region of the land of Havilah, which Gihon encircles, as it is said in Genesis 2, and it is similar to its golden mountains and aromatic spices and in gems, as Pliny says.

About Parthia

Parthia is the largest region in Asia, extending from the borders of India to the borders of Mesopotamia. Because of the great virtue of the Parthians, Assyria and the regions of the Seres took their name from them. Moreover, there are particular provinces in it, namely Arachosia, Parthia, Assyria, Media, and Persia, which regions share borders with each other, take water from the Indus River, and are enclosed by the Tigris River. Moreover, the places are mountainous and rough, and there are many rivers. Moreover, the provinces are distinct with their own borders, named after their own authors. Thus, Arachosia is named after its town; the Parthians, however, coming from Scythia, occupied it, because they called it by their own name. This kind of thing is connected to the Red Sea to the south, to the Hyrcanian Sea to the north, and to the Median kingdom to the west, extending from the Caspian Sea to the Scythian people. Parthia is wonderful with many prodigious and monstrous things, as Pliny says in book 5. For the beasts are fierce, leopards, tigers, and lynxes, and there are asps and serpents there, of a very fierce and cruel nature. The people are also harsh and cruel, and frugal in diet, content with salt and cardamom for food and drink, as it says there and it is said in the gloss on Daniel about the region of the Persians and Parthians, chapter 7, about the beast that was like a bear.

About Palestine

Palestine is a province also called Philistia, whose metropolis, which is now called Ashkelon, was formerly called Philistia, from which city the entire region of Palestine or Philistia was called in ancient times, as Ysidore says in book 15. Also, he says in book 9, chapter on the names of the Philistine peoples: the Philistines, he says, are those who are also called Palestinians. The Philistine language does not have the letter "P" in Hebrew, but uses the Greek "Phi" instead; therefore, Philistines are called Palestinians, so they are called from their own city. However, they were first called Alophisi, that is, aliens, because they were sons of Israel, alien and far separated from their society and race, as it says there in the same place. This region, as Ysidore says in book 15, has the Red Sea to the east, is bordered by Judea on the southern side, is enclosed by the borders of Tyre on the northern side, and is terminated by the Egyptian border to the west, as it says there. Moreover, the Philistines originally came from Canaan, from the son of Ham, named Cheth, from whom the Philistines and Canaanites first emerged, as it is said in Genesis 10. The people, as Herodotus narrates, are cunning and shrewd, always troublesome and hostile to the Israelite kingdom, both because they envied the prosperity of the Jews and also because they presumed too much on the happiness of their land and on the strength and power of subjecting the islands of the sea to their dominion, as it says in the same place.

About Pamphylia

Pamphylia, which is also called Isauria, because it is full of all kinds of gold, as Ysidore says in book 15, is a province in Asia Minor. It has a metropolis, a city that is called Seleucia, as it says in the same place, which Seleucus Antiochus, who founded Antioch, founded, as Ysidore says in book 9, chapter 5. Moreover, it is a maritime region between Cilicia and Bithynia, from which one sails to Italy through the island of Cyprus, as in Acts 27.

About Pentapolis

Pentapolis is a region on the border of Arabia and Palestine, named after the five cities of those people that were consumed by celestial fire. For the land, very fertile, more so than Jerusalem, is now deserted and burned. For because of the crime of the inhabitants, fire descended from heaven, which dissolved the region into ashes and embers, whose shadow and certain appearance is still seen in the embers and trees. Moreover, trees grow there, bearing fruits of such a beautiful appearance that they generate a desire to eat them, which, if you pluck them, fade and dissolve into ash and exhale smoke, as if they were still burning, according to Ysidore in book 15. This province, before its consumption, was so rich that sapphires and other precious gems were found in its fields, and among its clods Job touches on it, saying: The place of sapphires is its stones, and its clods are gold, Job 28. But afterwards that whole region was turned into the Dead Sea, so called because it produces nothing living, nor does it receive anything from the genus of things found. Neither fish nor birds nor ships pass through, because all things lacking life immediately sink to the bottom. If a lamp is lit, it floats and is extinguished, but if it is submerged, it is extinguished, as Ysidore says in book 14, where he speaks of the Dead Sea in the treatise on seas and waters. On the shore of this sea, near the borders of Sodom, grow the aforementioned apples, beautiful in appearance, but foul and bitter in taste, as the gloss says on the second epistle of Peter, chapter 2. Moreover, there is another Pentapolis of Africa in the province of Libya, so named from five cities: Berenice, Cyrene, Apollonia, Ptolemais, from which Ptolemais and Berenice are called from the regions. Moreover, this Pentapolis of Libya is joined to Cyrene and assigned to its borders, as Isidore says in book 15.

About Persia

Persia, or Persia, is a region of Asia assigned among the Parthian kingdoms, descending from the east to the Indus, having the Red Sea to the west, touching Media to the north, and Germany to the south, which is annexed to Persia, with the city of Meussa being the most noble. Moreover, magic art first originated in Persia, to which Nimrod the giant went after the confusion of tongues, and there he taught the Persians to worship fire. For those men in those parts worship the sun, which is called "Hel" in their language, as Ysidore says in book 15. Persia is named after Perseus, a king who, crossing from Greece into Asia, subdued the barbarian peoples there with long and continuous war. Finally, being victorious, he subjected the conquered race to his name, as Ysidore says in book 9, chapter 5, on the names of the races. For the Persians were considered ignoble for many times, and were held as if of no importance among the peoples; the Medes were always more powerful, as it says there. Moreover, Persia is very wide and very dangerous, whose noble city is named Elam, so called from Elam, the son of Shem, from whom the race of the Persians first proceeded, as Ysidore says. And from Elam the Persians were first called Elamites. Moreover, in Persia is a most noble city named Elimayda, which is now called Persepolis, of which it is said in 1 Maccabees 6 and 2 Maccabees 9. Moreover, in Persia was a most noble and rich city, and a temple in it very rich in gold and silver, and there were golden weapons and lances and shields, which Alexander the Macedonian king left there.

About Ramathea

Ramathea, which is also Ramazota, is a region situated near Decapolis, called from the city of Ramatha, in which Samuel the prophet was born, and it is called by another name Arimathaea, from which Joseph was, a just man who anointed the Lord's body with Nicodemus and buried it honorably, as the gloss says on Luke 23, chapter 28. Moreover, it is situated in the tribe of Ephraim in Judea and located in the highest mountains, because of which it is also called Ramathia, that is, exalted. For "Rama" sounds exalted, as Jerome says. Moreover, the land, although mountainous, is fertile in fruits and in produce, in vineyards and in olives, irrigated by springs, the purity of the air is very healthy, the altitude of the site is very firm, as Jerome says, and very suitable for observing from a distance.

About Rutia

Rutia, or Ruthenia, which is also Moesia, is a province in Asia Minor, situated on the border of the Roman territories, having Gothia to the east, Pannonia to the north, Greece to the west, and Greece to the south. Moreover, that land greatly agrees with Bohemia and the Slavs in idiom and language. Moreover, that part is called Galatia, and its inhabitants were formerly called Galatians, to whom Paul the Apostle is said to have directed an epistle, see above about Galatia.

About Sabaea

Sabaea is a region in Arabia named after the son of Cush, who was called Saba. This does not extend to the Persian Gulf in a narrow tract of land towards the east, it approaches Chaldea to the north, it is bordered by the Arabian Gulf to the west, and it is adjacent to Ethiopia to the south. Moreover, it is a region giving frankincense and odors; for in its groves myrrh, cinnamon, frankincense, and other aromatic things are produced, as Ysidore says in book 15. Indeed, the region is rich in aromatic spices, in precious stones, and metals. There are also phoenixes and many wonders there, which are reported in the region of Arabia by the authors, about which see above about Arabia. The queen and ruler of these provinces was especially the Queen of Sheba, who, however, obtained the principality of all of Africa in her times, as Herodotus says. For she was queen of Ethiopia and Egypt, as the gloss says on 3 Kings 10, and consequently it is believed that she obtained other kingdoms of the west at that time.

About Samaria

Samaria, as Ysidore says in book 15, is a region of Palestine, so called from the metropolis city or town in antiquity. For Samaria was formerly a royal city in Israel, which is now called Sebastia by Augustus. This region lies in the middle of Judea and Galilee, beginning from a town whose name is Eleis, whose site is similar in nature to Judea, not differing from it in virtue, as Ysidore says, from which it took its name from a mountain named Somer, as it says in 3 Kings 16. However, from that country of the Samaritans a race later arose, which, having migrated from the Assyrians, inhabited Samaria, which was thenceforth called Samaria, that is, custody, because, after the people of Israel were captured, they were in custody of the country, indeed, they were left there for custody by the Assyrian kings, as Ysidore says in book 9, chapter 5, on the names of the regions, see above in the same place about Mount Samaria in the letter S.

OAboutf Spartiata

Spartiata is a region near Greece, which is also called Lacedaemon, named after Lacedaemon, the son of Semele, see about Lacedaemon in the letter L. The ancients call the Lacedaemonians and Spartians, as Ysidore says in book 9.

About Seres

Seres is a province in the east, it took its name from a certain town that is also called Seres; there wool is collected from trees, and silk is prepared from it. Whence the poet says of its inhabitants: unknown in face, but almost without voice, the Seres.

About Sina

Inam Sirus, grandson of Abraham through Kethura, is said to have named it after his own name, as Yb. says in books IX & XV. It borders the Euphrates River to the east, and to the west it is bounded by the Great Sea and Egypt. To the north it is bordered by Armenia and Cappadocia, and to the south by the Arabian Gulf, as the same author says. Its location extends in immense length, but it is narrower in width. It contains many provinces, namely Comagene, Phoenicia, part of which is in India, beyond the Saracens and Nabataeans. It is a very populous and fertile region, rich in grains and fruits, herds and flocks, horses, asses, and camels. It is very rich in incense, aromatic spices, and metals, with numerous cities and fortified camps, and is irrigated by noble rivers, lakes, and ponds, possessing noble seaports, especially in maritime Palestine and Phoenicia. The people are fierce and warlike, and engaged in various small-scale commercial activities. It also has many nations differing in appearance, language, customs, and manners. Some of them live in deserts, such as the Nabataeans and Saracens, some in mountainous regions, some in wooded areas and forests, with which those nations' regions abound, as Herodotus narrates.
Desichima

About Ichima

Ichima is a small land located in Samaria, in the middle of Judea and Galilee. It is named after Sichem, the son of Hamor, who built it. The city, which is now called Neapolis, was once called Sichem. The surrounding area is called Sichia, as Ys. says in book XVI. Jerome says that this was the portion of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph as an inheritance, and therefore that land belonged to the tribe of Ephraim. Joseph was buried there, and his mausoleum is still shown there today, as Jerome says. Jacob bought that land with hard-earned money, for one hundred lambs, as is proven in Genesis 33. And Jerome says that Jacob said he had taken it from the Amorite hands with a sword and a bow. There was a turpentine tree there, under which Jacob hid the idols of his sons. And then he ascended from Sichem to Luzan, also known as Bethel, as is said in Genesis 25. In this place, Joseph's brothers pastured their flocks. But when Joseph sought them, they were not found in Sichem, but in Dothan, where they sold him to the Egyptians. Abimelech, the son of Jeroboam, destroyed Sichem and, after killing the inhabitants, sowed salt in its vicinity, as is said in Judges 9. In this territory was Jacob's well, near which the Lord, tired from his journey, rested, and asked a woman to give him water to drink from that well, as is said in John 3. It is a place of great fertility, wonderful pleasantness, and great sublimity.
About Scythia

About Scythia

Scythia is a very large region, the inner part of which is Asia. The lower, or prior, part is in Europe, and this lesser part extends from the Maeotian marshes, bordering between the Danube and the northern ocean, as far as Germany, as Isidore says in book XV. The first part of this is Alania, then the Maeotian marshes, then Gothia, Dacia, and then Germany, where the Suevi occupy a large part, as he says. Therefore, Scythia has several regions, some of which are rich and some uninhabitable. In most places, they abound in gold and gems, but access is rare due to the savagery of the Gryphons. The best emeralds and pure crystal are found there, as the same author says. It contains monstrous men and immense beasts in many regions, such as lynxes, tigers, very fierce bears, and lions, especially in the deserts and the region near Hyrcania, which we discussed above.
About Trachonitis

About Trachonitis

Trachonitis is a region in Judea, over which Philip, the brother of Herod, presided. For the entire kingdom of the Hebrews was divided into four tetrarchies, the first of which was Galilee, whose tetrarch was Herod. The second was the land of Ituraea and the region of Trachonitis, over which Philip presided as tetrarch of both regions. The fourth was the region of Abilene, over which Lysanias, the brother of Herod and Philip, presided. Judea was divided into so many particular principalities by the Romans to subdue the pride of the Jews, as the gloss on Luke says, regarding that passage: "Philip being tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, etc."

About Troy

The province of Troy in Phrygia was originally called Dardania, named after Dardanus. Dardanus came from Greece to Phrygia, where he first reigned. After him came his son Erichthonius, then his grandson Tros, after whom the city of Troy and the surrounding country were named, as Yf. says in book IX. After the fall of Troy, many Trojans built a fleet and sought settlements in various parts of the world, expelling many nations and inhabiting their lands. From their progeny arose the most powerful nations of the world in later times, as the most truthful histories of various regions attest.
Here follows the second part of the world, which is called Europe.

About Attica

The province of Attica is the same as ancient Greece, part or city of which was called the city of Athens, which was once the nurse and mother of liberal arts and learning. Greece had nothing more illustrious, nothing nobler, than that which devoted itself to the study of divine wisdom, as Pliny and Ys. say in book XV. Plato was a doctor of the entire province of Attica. Demosthenes made its eloquence known for many centuries, as Sallust reports. But above all, Paul the disciple, an Areopagite, commends it, whose profound wisdom adorned almost all parts of the world, as Epiphanius says in his commendation of Dionysius the Areopagite, as Isidore also reports.

About Achaia

Achaia is a province of Greece in Europe, named in ancient times after a certain king Achaeus. This province is almost entirely an island. For it is surrounded on all sides by the sea, except to the north where it borders Macedonia. To the east it has the Cyrenean Sea, to the southeast the Greek Sea, to the south the Ionian Sea, and to the southwest and west the Cassopian Islands. Only on the northern side does it border Macedonia and Attica in Greece. The capital of this province is Corinth, a very fortified place, as Yb. says in book XIII. For access to it is difficult due to the altitude of its location, the multitude of its people, the strength of its fortifications, and its proximity to the sea. Corinthus, the son of Horestes, founded it, whom the Greeks call Corinth Hexam, i.e., in the administration of the republic, as Ys. says in book XVI.

About Alania

Alania is the first part of Scythia, which is the first and largest region of Europe. It begins at the Danube River, descending westward through the northern ocean and extending to the borders of Spain. Its eastern and southern parts, rising from the Pontus, are entirely surrounded by the Great Sea and end in the islands of Gades, as Isidore says in book XIV. Therefore, the first part of Scythia is Alania, which extends to the Maeotian marshes and as far as Dacia. It is a very wide region, containing many fierce barbarian nations, situated under a cold climate, declining from the east to the north.

About Germany

Germany is a noble and generous region in Europe, named after the Lemannus River beyond the Danube, according to Isidore, where many of that land's inhabitants lived, who were called Alemanni after the Lemannus River. This is also called Germany, as Is. says in book XIV, where he says that Dacia, which is the end of lower Scythia, borders Germany, having the Danube to the east, the Rhine River to the south, and the ocean to the north and west. And there are two Germanies, namely Upper Germany, which extends as far as the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea or the Adriatic Sea, where the Great Sea ends in the Aquileian parts through the marshes. Lower Germany is around the Rhine. Both Germanies are rich lands and famous, and numerous in both towns and wealth, and warlike peoples. Hence, from the fertility of the people being born, it is called Germany from "germinando" (to germinate), as it says in book XV. It begets generous and immense peoples, about whom it is said in book IX of Is. that the Germanic nations are many, having immense bodies, strong in strength, bold in spirit, fierce, untamed, occupied with plunder, capture, and hunting, handsome in appearance and form, long-haired and blond, generous in spirit, cheerful and jovial, and especially the Saxons, who are superior to the aforementioned. About whom Ys. says: "The Saxon race," he says, "situated on the shores and coasts of the ocean, is agile in virtue and agility." Hence it is so called because it is a very strong race of men, superior to other pirates. For they are troublesome to their enemies not only by land, but also by sea, and are as unbearable and difficult to deal with as if they were made of stone. Their land is very fruitful, irrigated by excellent waters and rivers. In their mountains, almost all metals are mined, except tin. There are also other provinces in both Germanies that are not unworthy of praise, such as Austria, Bavaria around the Danube, Swabia, Alsace around the Rhine, and many others, which it would be tedious to enumerate individually. From the Germanic Saxons came the Angles, whose progeny and succession possess the island of Britain, whose language and customs the English race still uses today in many ways, as Bede says in "De Gestis Anglorum" (On the Deeds of the English). See below about Ireland.

About Saxony

About England

England is a very large island in the ocean, surrounded by the sea and divided on all sides from the rest of the world, which was once called Albion from the white cliffs that appear from afar around the shores of the sea. In later times, certain nobles from the destruction of Troy, departing with a fleet, as the oracle of Pallas is said to have foretold, arrived at the shores of the aforementioned island, who, fighting fiercely with the giants who then possessed the land, overcame the giants by skill and strength and subjected the island to their rule. And Brutus, who was the prince of that army, named the land Britain, as if it were an island acquired by Brutus by arms and power at that time, from whose progeny most powerful kings proceeded, whose magnificent deeds, if it pleases anyone to hear, let him read the history of Brutus. However, that same island, after a long time, was acquired by the Germanic Saxons through many and various interventions and fierce battles, and was possessed by their descendants, who, with the Britons either dead or exiled, divided the island among themselves and, assigning to each province the seat of their language, their property, and their name, left behind the memory of their language, calling the island England after Engela, the daughter of a most famous Saxon duke, who possessed that island after many battles. Yet Yh. says that it is called Anglia from "angulo" (angle), as if it were a land situated in the end or corner of the world. And St. Gregory, hearing that English boys were being sold in Rome in pagan times, alluding to the name, replied with a pious word: "They are Angles," he said, "having faces so bright that they look like angels. It is fitting to announce the tidings of salvation to them." For, as Bede says, Germanic nobility still abounded in the worship of idols. Pliny says many things about this island, and Orosius likewise, but Isidore touches upon the main points expressly, which others have related obscurely. Britain, which is now called England, is an island situated opposite the coast of Gaul and Spain. For its circumference is estimated at 487,000 miles, and there are many large rivers and warm springs in it. There is a large supply of metals, jet stone is abundant there, and also pearls. The soil is excellent and very suitable for various fruits. There are long-fleeced sheep in great abundance. There is an immense multitude of wild deer. Few wolves and no snakes are found on the island, and therefore the sheep, which abound there, are safely left in the fields and pastures without a guard, as Bede says. Hence, someone describing the English island in verse said: "England, a fierce land and a fertile corner of the world, a blessed island that scarcely needs the whole world, whose entire world needs its help. England is full of jokes, a free people fit to joke: a free people, a free mind, and a free tongue. But the tongue is better and more willing to speak of many things." It would be tedious to insert many other praises and dignities of the island here, which are discussed below under Britain.

About Aquitaine

Aquitaine is a province of Gaul in Europe, as Isidore says in book XIII, and it is so called from the oblique waters of the Loire River, which is its boundary on the northern side, which almost encircles it. The land is indeed fertile, distinguished by many towns, cities, and fortified camps, irrigated by waters and rivers, adorned with forests, fields, shores, and meadows, planted with vineyards and fruit-bearing trees of various kinds, and rich in great wealth. Under the name of Aquitaine, many particular provinces are comprehended, as Pliny says. It has the ocean to the west, as Orosius says, which is called the Aquitanian Gulf. It has Spain to the west, Lugdunensis Gaul to the north and east, and Narbonensis province to the southeast and south, as Orosius says.

About Anjou

Anjou is a province of Gaul, which is adjacent to Aquitaine and extends as far as Lesser Britain. Its metropolis is called Angers, after which the entire province around it is called Anjou. It is a land rich in wine and fruit, abounding in all good things, similar to Aquitaine in vineyards and grain.

About Auvergne

Auvergne is a province of Lugdunensis Gaul, whose major city is now called Clermont. It has Germany to the east, Italy to the south, Narbonensis province to the west, and Gallia Belgica to the north. It is a wooded and forested land, mountainous, pastureland, full of wild animals and herds, fruitful and rich in wine in many places.

About Apulia

Apulia is a maritime region of Italy, which is part of Europe, separated from the island of Sicily by a strait of the sea. The land is indeed very populous, full of gold and silver, rich in wheat, wine, and oil, famous for its most noble cities, fortified with fortified camps and towns, fertile and abundant in grains and fruits of various kinds. It is the end of Europe towards the south, which alone is divided from Barbary by the sea. It is said to have hot springs that provide health and medicine to the infirm. The metropolis of that region is called Brindisi, which the Greeks once built and is said to be named from the Greek word "bruda," meaning "head of a deer" in Latin. For it is said to be arranged in the manner of a deer's head having a crown, as Ys. says in book XXVIII, chapter "On the Names of Cities." Adjacent to Apulia is the land called Capitanata, very fertile in grain, so that its soil is most fertile in producing a multitude of grains, from whose abundance many provinces, even those overseas, are sustained.

About Asturias

Asturias is a province in inner Spain, situated on the border of Europe and Africa, as Yf. says in book XIV. Hence the Asturians are named, who now inhabit near the Ystur River. Their land is almost entirely surrounded by forests and mountains, as the same author says. They are said to be sun-worshippers in relation to others, otherwise peaceful, generous, and kind, whose metropolitan city is named. The land indeed abounds in wine, wheat, and oil. For the land is cold and less suitable for this kind of production of grains or fruits. However, millet and chestnuts abound there in great measure. It is said that many kinds of fruits and apples grow there, from which the locals make a drink for themselves. They are most rich in wild animals and also domestic livestock. The people, however, are generally said to be cheerful by nature and have a melodious voice, agile in running, and warlike in battles, of elegant stature and beautiful form, but their location, their native land, and the quality of the cold region make their language difficult to speak or understand.

About Aragon

Aragon is a province in Spain, fertile in grains and fruits, irrigated by springs and rivers, once occupied by the Aragoths, from whom the region is still named today. The race of the Rangoths lived in that province. Hence Aragon is called almost Aragothia, as Yh. says, through which the Ebro River flows. Its metropolis is called Caesaraugusta.

About Brabant

Brabant is a province on the border of Germany, which is adjacent to Gallia Belgica, having the Rhine to the east, the British Ocean and the Flemish Gulf to the north, Lower Gaul to the west, and Upper Francia to the south. The Ammis Mosa flows through it, and the Scheldt River, entering with the ebb and flow of the sea, irrigates it with many other various springs and fountains. The land is rich in wine in many parts, wooded, adorned with hills, meadows, and shores, with fruit-bearing and wild trees, such as deer, rabbits, boars, hares, and rabbits, having many famous towns and cities. The land is fertile in grains and populous. The people are of elegant stature and beautiful form, warlike and spirited against enemies, but peaceful and quiet among themselves.

About Belgium

Belgium is said to be a province of Gaul in Europe, named after the city of the Belgae, as Yf. says in book IX. It has Germany or the Rhine River to the east, as Orosius says, the Pennine Alps to the southeast, the province of Narbonensis to the south, in which the city of Arles is situated, the province of Lugdunensis to the west, the British Ocean to the northwest, and the island of Britain or England to the north. This region is fertile in grains and fruits, and rich in wine in many places, very populous, fortified with cities and towns. Its people are naturally fierce, as Ys. says in book IX, and spirited, irrigated by rivers and streams, adorned with arable lands and very fertile woods and meadows, full of livestock and cattle, having few monstrous creatures except frogs and snakes, generating few poisonous things. Therefore, the land is generally peaceful and quiet. It is subdivided into many peoples, differing slightly in language.

About Burgundy

Burgundy is a part of Gallia Zenonensis, which extends as far as the Pennine Alps, and is called Burgundy from the "burgi" (fortified places) that the Ostrogoths built there when they entered Italy, i.e., many towns and fortifications. The land is indeed forested and mountainous and pastureland, and wooded in many places, irrigated by waters and rivers and streams, fertile and fruitful in many places, and sterile and marshy in many others. Near the Alps, it is very cold, due to the frequent rains and mountain snows. There are many inhabitants near the Alps who, from frequent use of the mountain air, become goitrous and strumous under the chin. It abounds in wild animals, namely bears, boars, deer, and many others.

About Cantabria

Cantabria is a province of Spain, named after the city and river Hiberus, whose people are stubborn in their inclination to robbery and warfare, and are always ready to endure beatings, as Ys. says in book IX. Adjacent to it is Celtiberia, so called from the Celtic Gauls and the Hiberus.

About Campania

Campania is a province of Italy, located between the Roman territory and Apulia, whose metropolis was once Capua, extracted from the Alban king Silvius, so called from its capacity, because that land receives all the fruits of life. Hence, Capua is called one of the three greatest cities of Campania, Rome and Carthage. From which province Italy was once named Campania. There are many other famous, wealthy, and populous cities belonging to the province of Campania, such as Naples and Pozzuoli, where the baths of Virgil were held in honor. The land abounds in vineyards, grains, and olive trees, wild animals, and fruits of various kinds. There is also another Campania Casaluina, a province of Gallia Zenonensis, whose capital city is Trecentis.

About Dacia

Dacia is a region in Europe, first occupied by the Greek Daci, as it is said, subdivided into many islands and provinces, contiguous to Germany, whose people were once fierce and very warlike, because they dominated the islands of the Butanci and many regions of the Avars. Isidore says in book IX that the Dacians were offspring of the Goths, and they were called Dacians as if they were "dagos de Gothore," i.e., procreated from the race of the Goths. However it may be that they were first procreated, it is certain that they are very populous, of elegant stature, beautiful hair, generally of handsome appearance and form. The people, though fierce in spirit against enemies, are naturally pious and of a peaceful mind towards any innocent person.

About Europe.

Europe is said to be the third part
of the world, named after Europa, the daughter of Agenor,
king of Libya, whom
Jupiter, taking her from Africa, led to Crete
and called the greatest part of the world
by her name, as Yb.li. says.
ximi: But Oro says about Europe, saying
The regions and peoples of Europe begin
from the mountains, Upleis and the Meotidian marshes
which are to the east, descending
to the west along the northern shore of the
ocean as far as Gallia Belgica and the
Rhine River, which is to the ocean, then
to the Danube, which they call the Histrum, which
is directed from the south and to the east
is received by the Pontus. Isidore, however, li.xiij.
says that it begins at the Thanais River, descending
to the west through the northern
ocean as far as the borders of Spain, whose
eastern and southern part rises from the Pontus,
is entirely joined to the great sea
and ends in the islands of Gades. The first
region of Europe is Scythia Minor, which
beginning from the Meotidian marshes, extends through the Danube
and the northern ocean
as far as Germany, as Yfi says.
li. xiiij. And this land, because of the barbarian
peoples, is specifically called barbarian.
And there are peoples in the universe, as Oro says.
lijij: Among whom the first is Alania
which extends to the Meon Des marshes. Py-
gothia. Then Dacia. And after Germany
then Gaul. And Butama Island and Orca-
des and many islands, finally Spain Minor
in whose borders Europe ends from
the western parts. But from the
superior part it has many and great regions, namely Pannonia, Moesia, Thra-
cia, Greece with its borders: Italy
with its islands and its extremities: This small
part of the world, even if it is smaller than Asia, is still
more numerous in population and noble
in generosity. For the peoples, as Pli says, are greater in body,
stronger in spirit, bolder in mind,
more beautiful in form and appearance
than the regions of Asia or Africa, the sun's
solar heat has burned, because of its per-
manence over those Africans, it has effected
consuming humors, shorter in body,
greater in face, curlier in hair, and
because of the evaporation of spirits through ap-
propriate pores, less effective in mind. On the other hand
the opposite is true among the northern peoples. Aa-
from the cold, the pores are blocked externally,
humors are generated in the body and
men become more corpulent. And from
the cold itself, which is the mother of whiteness,
and from the reflection of vapor and spirits
to the interior, they become hotter inten-
sely and consequently more audacious. Ho-
wever, the men of Asia, whose region is closer
from the middle east, are like this
as Pliny says

About Hellas

Hellas, or Ellas, is a province in Greece
in Europe, first named after King Hellen,
Deucalion's son, from whom the Greeks were first
called Hellenes: and in this province is the Attic
people, where once was the city of Athens,
mother of the liberal arts: nurse of philoso-
phers. Which once had nothing
Greece was more famous, nothing more noble, to which
the province of Achaia is nearby,
as Ysid says. li. xiiij. Of this Hellas
there is a double province, namely Boeotia and
Peloponnese: about the first, that is, Boeotia, above
it has been said: about the other it will be said later: To this
Hellas adjoins Hellespontus: and there are many
things there that are very wonderful, as Pli says. li. vi.c. iij-
Next to Hellespontus, he says, there is a race of men
called Trages Pergamei,
whom they call Ophioges, whose contract
heals snake bites. And with only the hand

applied, they extract what is deadly
venom. Varro also says that there are still
some there whose saliva heals
against the bites of snakes and serpents: It is
however, Hellespontus, a bay of the Mediterranean
sea, as Yside says. hi. xiij. in the north
it is narrow: which with great windings
next to Greece and Hilincu in narrow
seven stadia is constricted. Where Xerxes
the king made a bridge of ships and thus into Greece
he terrified. But the water widens and
makes Propontis. which soon in fifty
paces is constricted. The bay is named
after Helle, the sister of Fuxi, who
fleeing her stepmother's wickedness, fell into the sea
re and died. Whose fall gave the name
to Hellespontus, both to the sea and to the tower in the circuit

About Franconia

Franconia is a German province
in Europe, named after the Franks of that
region
whose metropolis is called Herbipolis.
Situated above the Main River. From the east
it has Thuringia and Saxony. From the south
the Danube and Bavaria. From the west
Swabia and Alsace: from the north the Rhenish
province, whose metropolis is
Mainz, situated above the Rhine, which the Moselle
enters there. But it is a land
very good in terms of grains and vineyards, filled
with strong towns and fortified castles and
very populous

About France

France, which is also called Gaul, was first
named after the German Franks, as it is said,
or from Sfaco the executioner, who suc-
ceeded in the region of Paris: from whom the executioners
were privileged before the king. And from that
Frank, France is named, from the east
it has the limit of the Rhine River and Ger-
many. From the south it has the Pennine Alps
from the south Narbonne. From the northwest the British Ocean
Ocean. From the north the British Island
Island. And this France, once Gallia
Belgica, is called after the city that is called Belgis
called, as Ysid says. li. xiin & Oro. This
France has a fertile soil,
fertile in trees,

vines, fruits, and grains,
remarkable for the abundance of rivers and fountains,
which two very noble rivers flow through
in its extremities, namely the Rhone
and the Rhine. as Ys says. li. xiiij. Stones
and quarries it has noble and for co-
building buildings, unique, especially
the Parisian soil. Because in gypsum, or
vitriol, commonly called plaster by the inhabitants,
it excels. For the earth is vitreous
and transparent, transformed by mineral virtue into stone,
which stone, burned and with
water tempered, is converted into cement,
whence walls and buildings are made. Te-
studines and multiple pavements and
this kind of cement, placed in work and
molded or placed: in the manner of
stone it hardens again. And since it has many
France has noble and famous
cities, Paris among all deservedly
obtains the principality. Just as once
the city of Athens, mother of the liberal arts
arts and sciences: nurse of peoples and source
of all sciences, decorated Greece
Thus Paris in our times not only
France, but also the rest of all of Europe
has sublimated in science and in morals.
As if the mother of wisdom, from
all parts of the world coming
it gathers. To all in necessities it sub-
vents. Peacefully it governs all and as if
the cultivator of truth, it shows itself to the wise and un-
wise: A rich city,
powerful in riches and resources: rejoicing in peace,
air and river suitable for philosophers,
fields, meadows and monasteries
beautiful, refreshing and restoring the eyes in study.
Suitable for students in terms of houses and do-
miciles. And Melun is sufficient for the refection and
reception of all others frequently
visiting it, surpassing all other cities in these similar things

About Flanders

Flanders is a province of Gallia
Belgica, situated next to the shore of the ocean
constituted, having Germany from the east of
the British Island from the north:
from the west the Gallic Sea: from the south
Gaul Senonensis and Burgundy:
This province, although small in terms of land area,
is nevertheless filled with many singular goods.
For it is a land very rich in pastures,
and full of herds and cattle,
very famous for its noble towns and ports.
famous for its rivers, namely the Scheldt and the Lys,
irrigated and perfused on all sides. Its people are
elegant in body and robust: prolific
in offspring and in substance, rich in the riches of all
merchants, generally beautiful in face and
decorated, pious in affection, gentle in speech,
mature in gesture, honest in habit,
peaceful towards domestic people, very faithful towards
strangers: excellent in art and ingenuity
in woolen work, whose industry
the great part of the world is helped in wool processing, transforming
the precious wool that
England communicates to it into noble cloths,
it administers many regions by sea and land.
But it is a flat and fertile land
in many places, indeed having many
trees, not mountainous, many forests,
enjoying some marshy places
in which they dig clods that supply the lack of forests
for fuel: for from these a hot and strong
fire is usually made, more effective than from wood:
but more mutable and lively in terms of ash,
more abundant in terms of redolence and odors.

About Frisia

Frisia is a province in the lower
parts of Germany above
the shore of the ocean, constituted in a very long tract,
which begins at the end of the Rhine and ends at the Danish Sea.
The inhabitants of which are called Frisians
by the Germans. But in habit
and in morals they differ greatly. Aa-
men are almost all tonsured in a circular hairstyle,
who, the more noble they are, the more
highly circumcised they gloriously considered themselves.
But it is a people strong in spirit,
tall in body, severe in mind and fiercer
in body than the English, using iron spears
for arrows. The land is flat, pasture-rich, marshy
and grassy, lacking wood, for fuel
they often use bituminous turfs or dried cow dung.
Indeed, the people are free, not subject to another lord
outside their own nation.
They expose themselves to death for the sake of freedom,
and they prefer death to the yoke of op-
pressive servitude. Therefore, they reject military dignities
and do not allow anyone among themselves to assume
a sublime position under a military title.
However, they are subject to judges whom they elect annually
from themselves, who order and dispose of the republic among themselves:
they are very zealous for chastity and punish all impiety
severely. They keep their sons and daughters
chaste until almost the end of adolescence,
from which it follows that at that time, given in marriage, their
offspring are born complete and robust

about Galatia

Galatia is a region in Europe, from
the ancient peoples of Gaul, from
whom it was occupied, as Yh says.
ix. &. xiiij: for the Gauls, called by the king of Bithynia
to help, divided the kingdom with him,
having obtained victory. And thus from then on,
mixed with the Greeks, first Gallo-Greeks, now
however, from the ancient name of the Gauls, Gal-
li are called and their region is called Galatia.
But it is a very wide and fertile region
Europe contains a large part
which is now called Ruthenia by many
about Gaul.
Gaul of Europe is a province between
the Pyrenees Mountains and the British
Ocean. Which also
is so named from the whiteness of the people:
galla in Greek means milk. And Ion-
sibilla calls those Gauls, i.e. white, saying.
then milky necks are connected with gold
for there is a diversity of sky and
faces of men and colors, diversities of minds
and quantities of bodies.
Hence Rome generates serious people, Greece
light people: Africa changeable people. Gaul naturally
fierce, also sharp in mind, as Ind says.
liixihee region from the east has Germa-
ny. From the west Spain. From the south
Italy, from the north, however, it is bounded by the British
Ocean, as Isidore says.
This was once tripartite, namely
Belgica, Celtica and Togata, but these provinces
the Franks now inhabit, from whom France
is called, about which above about the Franks and

about Greece

Greece is called after the Greek king
who inhabited that region
and named it after his name: as
Ys says. li xiij. These are its provinces sep-
ten from the west: Dalmatia: then Epi-
rus. Then Hellas, then Thessaly, then Mace-
donia: and then Achaia. And two in the sea:
namely Crete and the Cyclades. But it is a region
very wide, named by many other names:
rich in the riches of land and sea:
mistress of many kingdoms. Mu-
cie nutux. mother of philosophy. Muen-
tux of all good things: mistress of arts
Whose people were once very warlike, endowed
with the gift of wisdom and science: very eloquent in speech,
subject to laws: pious towards
strangers: peaceful towards the inhabitants and
quiet domestic people. Against the threats of enemies
very liberal and hostile: Varro narrates about the praises of the Greeks

about Galicia

Galicia is a province in Spain
named so from the whiteness of the people of the region.
They are said to be whiter than all other
parts of the Spaniards. The land is said to be fertile,
close to the ocean, abounding in many good things.
They believe that they have Greek origins: whence also
they are strong in nature and mind, as Ys says. li. ix.
for after the end of the Trojan War, many
from the Greeks went to Gaul and remain there
until the present time

about Gothia

Gothia of Scythia Minor is a province
in Europe, which, as it is believed, is called after Magog,
the son of Japheth, as Yb says. li-
ix.. Whence he says that the ancients named those Navones
more Getae than Goths:
and it was once a strong people,
huge in body, most terrible in the kind of arms.
From whose offspring the greatest
part of Europe and Asia is believed to be populated:
for their offspring are the Dacians and
many other nations from the western part
Getuli in Africa, Amazons in Asia from the Gothic
progeny proceeded, as Iden says.
li. ix. & xiiij: But even today the region is very wide,
having Norway and Dacia from the north, in its other sides
it is surrounded by the ocean. To this region
adjoins a certain island named Gotlan-
dia: called the land from the Goths because it was inhabited by the Goths in ancient times:
and it is a fertile island, very rich in pastures and fish
and very busy with many kinds of merchandise.
For various skins and other copies from various regions
are brought by ship to that island. And from there
into Gaul: into Germany. into Britain
and Spain they lead through the ocean

about Italy

Italy is a great region in Eu-
rope: occupied by the Greek people
in ancient times: and therefore it is called Magna Graecia:
as Ys says. li. xiij then
it was called Saturnia after King Saturn, because
Saturn, expelled from his seats by Jupiter,
lay hidden there. Finally, from Italus, a Sicilian
king reigning there, Italy is called: whose
site extends more in length than in la-
titude: it extends to the sharp south. From the south
it is bounded by the Tyrrhenian Sea: from the north by the Adriatic
sea, from the west by the ridges of the Alps.
The land is most beautiful in all things:
very heavy with the fertility of the soil: the abundance of pasture.
It has noble lakes
such as Venatus, Avernus, and Lucernus.
many other noble rivers. namely
Endanus or Padus. Tiber: Henia nun-
and the like. It generates gems, namely
Ligurian agate. pearls: and co-
rallum, it also bears serpents. and the lynx
beast: and many other singular species of birds
This region is called Hesperia:
from the star Hesperus. just as Spain also. eo

that the Greeks, sailing into Italy and Spain,
considered that star: or
it is called Hesperia Ultima: because it is placed
in the last place under the west: Up to here
yb.li xiiij Among all the European
western regions, Italy obtains
the principality: For it has noble
islands and very famous ports,
provinces rich in all riches. ci-
very prolific cities: fortified with walls, ditches
and other warlike preparations.
abounding in gold and silver in abundance

rivers, namely the Rhine and the Danube, which
flow through Germany and the Rhone with the Seine
and many others that flow around Gaul, especially
Lugdunensis. and Narbonensis Belgica in
many places.

about Carinthia.

Carinthia is a moderate province
of Germany in Europe: having
Pannonia from the east, from
the west Italy. the Danube from the north
orione: Dalmatia and Salmomana from the south
tridie. It rises with mountains in one part and
ends in the Adriatic Sea in another. And it is
a fertile land in many places: abounding
in wild animals, cattle and livestock, a warlike people
and strong. fortified in towns and in ca-
stris. But it is a land cold in many places because of the proximity of the Alps
and frequent with rivers. Where, because of the coldness of the waters
from many solitudes around the mountains
very many are said to be strumous. There
are many bison: and other wonderful and wild beasts
rabile and wild. There are also edible dormice
who, although they seem to be of
the genus of mice: they are eaten however, whose
flesh is tasty and fatty

about Lacedaemonia

Lace de moma, which is also called
Sparta, is a province in the borders of Greece
next to Thrace in
Europe, whose inhabitants are called Lacedaemonians
from a certain Lacedaemon, son of Semome.
These Lacedaemonians, fearing the length
of the war against the Messenians, ordered that
their virgins should lie with the soldiers, leaving their husbands at home
thus from the promiscuous intercourse of vir-
gins many men were born, who were called Spartans from the mother's loss of modesty, as Di-
cit Ysi dorus libro. x.

About Livonia

Livonia is a province of the Scythian region
special. which with a long sea
interconnection is divided from the borders of Germany
many. Whose inhabitants were called Livonians in ancient times:
whose rite was wonderful. before they were forced by the Germans
from the culture of demons to the faith and worship of God.
For they worshiped many gods, from whom they sought responses
from demons with profane and sacrilegious sacrifices, they served auguries and divinations:
they did not hand over the corpses of the dead to the tomb
But after making a very large pyre for the people
they burned them to ashes: after death, however, they dressed their friends in new clothes
they dressed them so that they could provide them with sheep and oxen and even other animals
many provisions. assigning servants and maids to them
with other things, burning them together with the dead and other things, believing that
they would happily reach a certain joyful region
and that they would find their homeland there with livestock and servants, because of the great
multitude of combustions of happiness and temporal joy: This
homeland, fascinated by such an ancient error of demons
time, now in a large part with many regions subject
or annexed, by the preceding divine grace
and the cooperating power of the Germans, is now believed to be freed from the aforementioned errors

about Lorraine

Lorraine is the last and final
province of Germany, named after King
Lothair. This from the east has
Rhetia or Brabant, from the south
the Rhine and Alsace: from the west
Gaul Senonensis: from the north Gaul
Belgica: the Meuse River flows through this.
In this the city of Metz is located: But it is
a region fruitful in many places, rich in vineyards
irrigated with fountains and rivers, mountainous
forested, wooded: rich in livestock
and herds, the people are mixed from
Gauls and Germans. It has wonderful and medicinal
fountains, from whose drink
various languors are healed-

About Macedonia

Macedonia was initially named Emacia after King Emacius, but Maceto, the grandson of Decalion, after he held the principality there, changed the name and called it Macedonia after his own name, as Ys says in book 14. It is bordered by the Aegean Sea to the east, Achaea to the south, Dalmatia to the west, and Moesia to the north, as the same author says. It was the homeland of Alexander the Great and a region very rich in gold, veins, and silver.
In the same province is Mount Olympus, which rises to such a great height that neither clouds, winds, nor rain are felt at its summit, as the same author says. Regarding Macedonia, Pliny says in book 3, chapter 21: Macedonia was formerly called Emacia, situated in the middle of the lands. It has crossed Asia, Armenia, Iberia, Almamana, Cappadocia, China, Egypt, Taurus, and Caucasus. It was dominant in Bactria, Media, and Persia and possessed the entire Orient. This, namely, the nurse of India, is praised through the traces of Liber Pater and Hercules.

This is that Macedonia whose 70 cities Paulus Aemilius, the emperor, plundered and sold in one day, as the same author says.

About Magnesia

Magnesia is a province of Greece, located between Thessaly and Macedonia, containing many peoples, towns, and cities, as Pliny says in book 4, chapter 10.

About Moesia

Moesia is named from the abundance of its produce. It is the first province that the Danube encloses up to the Mediterranean Sea, as Ys says in book 14. It is bounded by the mouths of the Danube to the north, Thrace to the east, Macedonia to the south, and Histria to the west, as the same author says. It is a region containing many peoples, towns, and cities, abundant in fruits, rich in minerals, stones, and metals.

About Media

Media is named after King Medus, who first attacked that province. Media is bordered by the Parthian kingdoms to the west, Armenia to the north, the Caspian and Judean mountains to the east, and Persia to the south. This region alone produces the Median tree, which no other region grows, as Ys says in book 94. It is a very wealthy region, irrigated by many rivers, distinguished by cities and towns, densely populated by many peoples, whose kings anciently conquered great Babylon and the Chaldean empire. The inhabitants of this region, together with the Persians, crossed the sea to Africa and mixed with the Libyans, whom the Libyans, with corrupted language and barbarous speech, called Moors, although Moors are called "mauri" from their dark color in Greek, or "sievo-demissena"

About Missena

Missena is a province of Germany, named after the city that is called Missena, connected to Bohemia and Poland in the east, with Bavaria in the south, with Raetia and Tyrol in the west, and in the north

and it is a wide and spacious land, now flat, now mountainous, very fertile and pasture-rich, irrigated by many waters. The noble river Elbe, for the greater part, flows through its length, it has strong cities, fortified towns and castles, whose people are generally rich in wealth, namely in fruits, livestock, and metals. And although it is a people of great strength, beauty, and elegant stature, it is a kind and peaceful people by nature, having many Germans in all its borders.

About Norway

Norway is a very famous province in Europe, almost entirely surrounded by the sea, located under the north, bordering the kingdoms of the Goths. It is divided from Gothia on the south and east by a certain river that is called Elbe. It is very harsh and extremely cold, wooded and forested, whose inhabitants live more from fishing and hunting than from bread. For grain is rarely found there due to the great cold. There are many animals there, such as white bears; there are also beavers there, which are said to be castors; there are many and monstrous mice there. For there are springs there by which everything placed in them, whether wood or structure, is transformed into stone. In the middle of the northern part, the sun does not appear to set in the summer interval for several days, nor does the sun appear there for as many days at the winter solstice; therefore, at that time, the inhabitants of the land must work with candles; it is devoid of wheat and oil, from which it is adorned. But the people are of great body and stature and beautiful form, and of great strength and robust; they are strong pirates and of great animosity. It has Galicia to the east, Iceland to the north, where the sea is perpetually frozen, the Iberian Ocean and the British Ocean to the west, and is bordered by the borders of Dacia and Gothia to the south.

About Normandy

Normandy, which is also called Neustria, is named after the Normans themselves, who, coming by ship from Norway, seized the coast of Gaul, who eventually called the province inhabited in the circuit Normandy. It has the British Ocean to the east, the Aquitanian Gulf to the west, Gaul to the south, and the Ocean to the north. But its soil is fruitful and rich, distinguished by fields, forests, and meadows, noble in harbors, rich in wild animals and livestock, very strong in noble cities and towns, whose metropolis is called Rouen, a noble city on the river that is called Seine, whose people are populous, strong, and warlike, urban in habit, modest in affection, pious in speech, peaceful in conduct.

About Narbonne

Narbonne is a province, as Pliny says in book 2, chapter 6, and is called the part of Gaul that borders the Mediterranean Sea, which is now called Gallia Bracata, which is separated from Italy by the Narbo River and the Alps. No province is to be preferred to it in the cultivation of vineyards and the abundance of wealth, in short, it should be called Italy rather than a province. It has very noble rivers, among which the Rhone, the most fertile river of Gaul, rushing from the Alps, flows past the province of Narbonne. It has many lakes and several ports and many promontories, among which Marseille holds the chief place. The entire length of the province of Narbonne contains three hundred and seventy thousand paces, as Agrippa reports. So far Pliny.

About Holland

Holland is a certain modest province located near the mouths of the Rhine, where it enters the sea, bordering Brabant to the south, neighboring Frisia to the east, connected to the British Isles to the west, contiguous to Lower Belgic Gaul to the north, and to Flanders to the west.

It is a marshy and watery land, almost like an island, surrounded on all sides by arms of the sea and the Rhine River, having lakes and ponds and very good pastures, and therefore it is filled with herds of livestock and animals. Its soil is very fruitful in many places, and in many places wooded. It has many and useful hunting grounds. It is also very bituminous in many places, from which material suitable for nourishing fire is formed. And it is a land very rich in wealth that passes through the sea and through the rivers, whose capital city is called Utrecht in Latin. But it is called Striech in the language of the Germans. For it belongs to Germany in terms of its location, in terms of its customs, and in terms of its dominion, and also in terms of its language. Whose people are elegant in body, robust in strength, bold in spirit, beautiful in face, honest in morals, devoted to God, faithful to men, and peaceful, less inclined to plunder and robbery than other German nations.

About Pannonia

Pannonia, which is also called Hungary
Pannonia is a province of Europe, which, once occupied by the Huns, is commonly called Hungary by the same people. It is twofold, namely major and minor. The major one is located beyond the Maeotian marshes. From there, the Huns, initially going out for the sake of hunting, and following the tracks of deer and beasts through very long spaces of marshes and land, finally found the land of Pannonia. Returning to their own, having gathered an army, they returned to Pannonia and, having expelled the inhabitants, gave the name to the people and the country from their original origin, as Herodotus narrates. But this province is part of Moesia, which the Danube River flows past and irrigates, as Ys says in books 14 and 16. It has Galicia to the east, Greece to the south, Dalmatia and Italy to the west, and Germany to the north, as the same author says.

It is a very spacious and very fertile land, very rich in mountains and forests, irrigated by many rivers and waters, very rich in veins of gold and other metals. It has very large mountains in which various kinds of marble are found. Also, excellent salt is dug out in certain mountains. Pannonia is filled with wild animals and livestock because of its very lush pastures. Its soil is also very fruitful and wine-bearing in many places, and within itself it contains many peoples differing not only in language, but also in customs and life in many ways, as the same Herodotus says. He says, however, in book 14, that Pannonia is named after the Pannonian Alps, by which it is bordered from Italy. The region is strong and joyful in soil, and is surrounded by three rivers, namely the Danube, the Sava, and the Tisza. It has Moesia to the east, Histria to the east, and the Alps to the south, and Belgic Gaul to the west, and the Danube as a border to the north, which flows past Germany. This is called Hester and they call the land Histria which flows around next to Pannonia.

About Pyrenees
The Pyrenees is a province in Europe, a high and mountainous land, whose mountains are called the Pyrenees, and they extend from the south towards the west, dividing the largest regions from each other. For the Pyrenean Alps divide between Spain and Gaul, both Narbonne and also Lyon. It has Germany to the east, Italy to the south, Spain to the west, and Gaul to the north. The Pyrenees are said to be named from the frequent strikes of lightning, for "pir" in Greek is "ignis" in Latin. The Pyrenean mountains are frequently shaken by lightning strikes, as Ys says in book 14, chapter on mountains. The Pyrenees is full of many and large rivers, long and steep, a mother of very large forests, a nurse of wild animals and a home of many animals, containing veins of metals, having strong fortifications of cities and castles, nurturing many and diverse

both in language and in customs, nations of peoples, as Herodotus narrates.

About Pygmy

Pygmy is a region in India towards the east, located near the mountainous ocean, in which pygmies live, men small in body, scarcely a cubit tall, as Pliny and Ys say, who generate in the fourth year and grow old in the seventh. These, having gathered an army, ride on rams and fight against cranes, breaking their eggs and nests, lest enemies multiply against them, as the same Pliny says in book 5, chapter on monstrous men of India: look above.

About Poitou

Poitou is a province of Narbonne Gaul, which the Picts, Angles, and Scots, attacking by ship, inhabited in ancient times, and finally left the name to the region and the people from their ancient lineage, as the historian Herodotus narrates, who, making a fleet from British ships, moved the Aquitanian Gulf of the ocean and finally, against the inhabitants, unless by warlike decision, seizing the place and the country, named the town of Poitiers from the Picts, as it is said by the same Herodotus, they built and called the long border of the country Poitou. This province, stretched along the long ocean sea, has Touraine, which the Liger flows past, to the east, the Spanish to the south, the British Ocean to the north, and Lesser Britain in the Aquitanian Gulf to the west. This country is a very famous little province, as the same narrates. For the soil is said to have much fertile soil, productive of almost all fruits, and a nourisher of multiple fruits, it is wine-bearing and fruitful, and very rich in the good things that the earth produces, distinguished by sea ports, irrigated by cities and towns, rivers and springs, it is very pleasant with fields, meadows, and forests, and around the maritime parts it is fortified with rocks and cliffs, as in the town of La Rochelle or the castle, to which access is scarcely had because of the location of the place and the narrowness of the strait, as the same says, whose people are mixed in language and customs with the provinces of Gaul. And therefore, although from the first Picts, the nations of that race have this, that they are strong by nature, elegant in body, they have contracted this from the Gauls with whom they are mixed, that they are fierce in spirit and sharper in intellect than other races, nor is it surprising, as Ys says in book 9, that the diversity of the sky, the faces and colors of men, the sizes of bodies, the air and diversities exist. Therefore, we see that the Romans are heavy, the Greeks are light, the Africans are changeable, the Gauls are fierce by nature and sharper in intellect, which the nature of the climates makes one, as it is said there. And therefore the Pictish people are robust in body, beautiful in face, bold in spirit, as it is said, cunning in intellect and astute, as Herodotus recounts.

About Picardy

Picardy is a province of Belgic Gaul, named after a certain town or castle of Ponticus, as the same says about the regions in the description in Herodotus. For the town which is now called Pychen, in that border of the land up to the British Ocean, Phibern is believed to have anciently obtained dominion, from whom the entire people of that country is believed to have been named in the future. But their land is very productive of fruits and fruits, irrigated by springs and rivers, abundant in offspring, fortified by noble cities and castles, very strong and famous towns, as are the Belgians, or Beauvais, and Amiens, Arras, Mons, Tournai, as the same says. But the province already mentioned has the Rhine River of Germany to the east, Upper Gaul to the south, the Gallic Ocean to the west, Greater Britain or England to the north. But Picardy is twofold, namely the upper, which is more Gallic, as they say, the other lower, which is closer to Flanders and Raetia,

or connected to Brabant, and is called Hainaut. The people of both countries are elegant in stature, decent and beautiful in face, bold in spirit, light and docile in intellect, clear in intellect, pious in affection, gross in language, more avaricious than the nations of Gaul.

About Raetia

Raetia is a province of the Rhine, a region which the Rhine flows around and is named after it, because it is located next to the Rhine, as Ys says in book 14, and it is a land having many cities and towns very strong. Whose soil is fruitful and wine-bearing in many places. A strong and spirited people, having agreement in life and in customs with the Germans.

About Nvalia

Nvalia is a province, once barbarian, distant from Dacia, but now subject to the pious kingdom of Dacia, whose part is commonly called Vroma, named from its greenness, because it is grassy and pasture-rich, wooded in many places, whose soil is fruitful in the middle, irrigated by waters and ponds, fertile in fish and lakes, having many flocks of sheep and herds. Bordering on the parts of Scythia, it is separated from the regions of Norway and Irregard by the river which is called Arva, as Herodotus says.

About Incouia
Incouia is a certain modest land located near the city of Mainz, stretched out over the banks of the Rhine between the mountains and up to the town which is called Bingen, from which it is called Rincouia from the Rhine which flows back through its middle. And although it is a modest land, on both banks of the Rhine up to the mountain peaks, it is wonderfully pleasant and fertile, of such great beauty and such incredible fertility that it delights and refreshes both the inhabitants and even those passing by the bank, as if it were a garden of delights. For it has such a sweet soil and such a rich one,

that it bears and produces fruits and grains with wonderful fertility and speed. In that same field, fruit-bearing trees of various kinds are planted and nuts grow, and yet because of such a multitude of fruits, it does not omit to bear grains. Even the diversity of trees does not hinder the vineyards, but rather one and the same corner bears grains and wines, nuts and apples, pears and many other kinds of fruits. Hot and medicinal springs necessary for bodies arise there from the bowels of the earth. It has many other conveniences necessary for life, which it would be long to recite one by one.
of the province of the Romans.

About Rome

Rome is the province of the Romans, as Varro says, it is truly the end of the whole world, where it possesses the habitable regions of the age. For the power of the Romans has subdued all the individual parts of the world, nor was there any corner of the world that the army of Rome did not feel with the sword, as the same says. Therefore, it was once part of Italy, anciently named Romulea, named after Romulus, who founded the city of Rome and gave the name to the city and the people, as Ys says in book 20, where it is added that it was first called Saturnia after King Saturn, who first taught the inhabitants to cultivate the land, and they called him Saturn because of his abundance of wealth, and finally they worshiped him as a god in the number of the stars. But under King Alatmo they were called Latins, who afterwards were called Romans from Romulus enlarging and fortifying the city of Rome, and who were afterwards called Quinctii, because Romulus was called Quinctus, who always used a spear, which is called "quins" in the Sabine language, as Ys says in book 9, in the chapter on the naming of peoples. But the pen is not sufficient to fully describe the praises of this kingdom and its kings, nor does any book comprehend the magnificent works of the Romans. If anyone delights to read about the virtues of the acts of the Romans for the sake of imitation, let him read in the first book, chapter 7, where their wonderful virtues are briefly recounted.

About Romania

Romania is called the new race of Romans. For "nea" in Greek means "nova" or "novum" in Latin. For from that time when Constantine transferred the seat of the Roman Empire from Rome to Constantinople, a city of Thrace, the entire region of the Greeks was called Romania, that is, New Rome, as Rabanus says. Therefore, even today the Greeks do not commonly call themselves Greeks, but rather Romans: look above about Greece in letter G, where many things are repeated about the Greeks.

About Sambia

Sambia is a province of Moesia in lower Europe, located in Scythia, as if it were in the middle between the Pratenes, Estenes, Ofilians, and Atrones, all of whom were anciently under the power of the Goths, as Varro narrates: similarly Herodotus inhabits the shores of the ocean, making promontories and bays against the sides of the north, as the same says. But Sambia is a fertile land in soil and productive of fruits, a marshy and wooded land, surrounded by rivers and lakes, a people elegant in body among other barbarians, bold in mind, skilled in art and craft, excelling other nations in the vicinity in plunder.

About Sabandia

Sabandia is said by the ancients to be like a safe and bold way, because in ancient times that way, by the special goodness of the Gauls, was always safe from Italy through the borders and mountains of that country. For there was always supreme justice there. And therefore, as public fame proclaims, those passing through were always free from common plunder and injury. But it is part of the Pyrenees, by whose mountains Italy and Gaul are separated: which look above about the Pyrenean mountains in letter P. And by another name it is called the province of the province.

About Saxony 

Saxony is a province in Germany whose inhabitants are said by the Greeks to have contracted their origin, and having arrived by ship from the parts where they now live, and having expelled the Thuringians, who then inhabited up to the coast of the ocean, they obtained it after many battles, and have remained in the same province to this day. For the people have always been very warlike, of elegant form, tall in stature, robust in body, and bold in mind. But Saxony is a land very fertile in soil, very productive of all fruits, fruitful and pasture-rich in mountainous, wooded, and field areas, rich in flocks and herds, rich in silver, copper, and other mines and metals. For it has distinguished mountains from which stones are dug out which, when strongly heated, are converted into the substance of iron. And it has very noble and famous rivers, namely the Weser, the Liiaz, the Elbe, the Saale, and the Mulde, and many others which flow past the land across the Elbe. It has salty springs in many places, from which very white and excellent salt is cooked and prepared. It has many very strong and fortified cities, strong towns, and very strong castles, both in the fields and in the mountains. Near the mountain where copper is dug, a large mountain is found whose stones smell like violets. Also, very beautiful marble is found in certain other mountains, and this especially around the Danube, which stone is now called Saint Michael's stone. There is a very great confluence of wild animals and beasts in those mountains: boars and bears, deer and does. And therefore, many kinds of hunting are practiced in those wooded mountains. These and many other praiseworthy things are found in the regions of Saxony: look above about Germany in letter G and in letter A about Almamana. Saxony also has Bohemia and Poland to the east, Westphalia to the west, Frisia bordering the ocean to the north, and the people of Thuringia and the Franks to the south.

Whose strong and famous people persevere unconquered to this day, as Herodotus says.

About Sclavonia

Sclavonia is part of half of Moesia,
containing regions. The Slavs, Sclavi,
are Bohemians, Poles, Metam-
Wandals, Ruthenians, Dalmatians, and Croats,
all of whom understand each other. And their
appearance is similar in language and
in customs. They differ only in nature.
For some still hold to pagan
rites. Some, however, retain the
rites of the Greeks; others, however, Latin ones.
All these regions, however, are gle-
be optine & messifere & uimifere i mi
tis locis. All these, however, for the greater
part, have their hair cut in a coma. Except for the
Ruthenians and those who are mixed with Teuto-
nics and Latins. And there is a double Sclavonia,
the greater, which is also called Sclavoma, which Dal-
matia preserves in Arinihia; and con-
tains many other regions. These in-
habitants, some occupy the maritime regions, some
inhabit the ridges of mountains and dense groves,
some cultivate and plow the plains. A severe and harsh
people, and uncultured concerning divine worship, leading a life of piracy,
practicing plunder by sea and by land. Especially
those who live near the sea. The other Sclavonia,
the lesser, which extends from the borders of Saxony to the
Prussians, Wandals, having more of their own language
as neighbors and Bohemians. This Sclavonia
is said to be enclosed by Bohemia or Prussia on different sides,
and by the Goths and the Dama: a certain promontory of the sea
ocean. Which sea is divided with whose boundary the lesser Sclavonia ends and begins. This region, however, is
very fruitful and productive, irrigated by rivers
and ponds, wooded and pasture-
rich: with honey, abundance, and milk. A people strong
in body, dedicated to agriculture, and fishing.
More pious towards God and peaceful towards
their neighbor than those who live in the
greater Sclavonia; and this is because of the mixing
and association which they daily have
with the Germans, as Erodocus says.

About Zealand

Zealand is a province, a maritime
land, like an island, surrounded by rivers
and sea straits.
It has Holland to the east,
Flanders to the south, the ocean to the west,
and Britain to the north.
There are many islands there, small and
large, separated from each other by sea straits
and distinctly. And these islands are
fortified with very strong embankments all around
against the force and threat of the sea, of which
the soil is very fertile for crops,
but almost bare for trees.
For trees cannot, because of the
saltiness of the sea, extend their roots.
And therefore, after planting, they quickly fail
and wither. Zealand, however, is very
populous, rich, and diverse.
A people of great stature, strong in body, and
bold in mind, very devoted to the worship of God,
peaceful and quiet among themselves, beneficial to many,
troublesome to none, unless forced to resist the insolence of enemies.

About Senngallia

Senngallia is a modest province
situated beyond the Baltic Sea,
near Osisia and Livonia, located in
Sua Ifenon, so called because it is inhabited
by the Gallatians who occupy it, mixed with the inhabitants of the land;
hence the Senngalli are named, who proceeded from the Gauls or Gallatians and those
peoples. A good and fertile land, abundant
in pastures and meadows.
A barbarous and uncultured people, harsh and savage.

About Senonensis

Senonensis is a province of Gallia Fracore,
having Germany Treverorum from the east,
Upper Burgundy and the Pennine
Mountains from the south, Gallia
Lugdunensis from the west, and Gallia
Belgica from the north. A land of grains, vineyards, and
fruits, diverse in springs, rivers,
and nuts. The Gauls, however, Senonenses,
were once called Senones, because

they had received Xerus into their hospitality. Afterwards
its name was changed, as Ys says, li. ix,
from the city of Senonensis, which city is
their capital. The land, however, is populous,
having many cities and many strong and fortified
towns, which the river Sequana flows past
and irrigates.

About Sicioma

Sicioma was named from King Ficionus of old,
from whom also the kingdom
of the Ficiomori was named; which kingdom
Archas, Ious, and Caliste, sons of Pilastus, having reduced to their power,
named Arcadia from their own name. It was, however,
Arcadia, which is also Sicioma, the son of Archas,
like a plant exposed between the Ionian and Aegean Sea,
having a great river, namely Enmatum. It also produces
albeston stone, which, once lit,
is never extinguished. There, very white
merula is generated, as Ysr says, li. xiij.

About Sicily

Sicily was first named by King Sicanus,
then by
Siculus, Italy, hence Sicily is called, which
was anciently called Trinacria, because of three
promontories, namely Pelorum,
Pacheum, and Libeu. Trinacria, indeed,
is Greek for what is called three quadrates in Latin,
because it is divided into three quadrates. This is
separated from Italy by a narrow strait, facing the African
Sea. A fruitful land,
abundant in gold, penetrable by caves and pipes,
full of winds and sulfur,
whence also the fires of Mount Etna rage.
In whose strait there is Scylla and Charybdis,
by which ships are either swallowed up or
collided. It was once the homeland
of the Cyclops and afterwards the nurse of the Titans,
fertile in grains, first of all lands
processed with the plow for sowing seeds.
It has Syracuse as its principal city,
and the fountain of Arethusa and the Albeus river,
generating a race of horses. In it was first
found the island of comedy, agate
stone from the Agate river. Sicily first
gave coral and the white Sicilian sea.

It generates salts from Agrigentum, which are soluble by fire,
but crackling in waters. The entire circuit is enclosed
by a space of three thousand stadia.
Salustius says that Sicily was joined to Italy,
but the middle space was divided by the force of the sea and torn apart.
Thus far Ys, li. xiij, ca. ij, concerning islands, where
all the above are recited. And Pliny narrates the same.

About Scotland

Scotland is named from the Scottish peoples
by whom it is inhabited, and it is
a promontory in the British island,
whence also it is separated from England to the north by rivers and sea
straits, on the opposite side, surrounded on all sides by the
ocean, by which Scotland is divided from Ireland.
The same people from the beginning, who once
in Ireland, are similar in all things,
in language and in customs and in nature. The
people are light, fierce in spirit, severe
to enemies, loving death almost as much as
servitude, considering it laziness to die in bed,
but in the field, to be killed fighting enemies, they consider it glory
and virtue. A people easily enduring hunger,
and rarely pouring themselves over food before sunset,
using more carmbr lacti-
cinijs, fish, and fruits,
having less use of bread than the British.
And although the people are of elegant figure and
beautiful face generally by nature,
their own habits greatly disfigure them,
or Scottish clothing. They are called Scots
in their own language: from the painted body, as if
cut, because they were anciently
marked with iron needles with ink figures.
As Ys says, li. ix, iij, ca. concerning
the names of peoples: the customs, however, of the
primitive people have changed for the better in many ways from the admixture
with the English in most parts in these
times. Whence whatever is decent and more honest, this has been contracted from the
English. The wild Scots, however, are like the Irish in habit,
in language, and in diet, and in other customs,
they primarily follow their own footsteps, considering it glory,

nay, they despise the customs of others in some way. Whence
each one strives to be superior, and they all
detract, and are always impudent in vices, and
they condemn all, and they reprehend the customs of others.
They do not fear to lie, nor do they esteem anyone
from whatever reason they arise,
whether from the offspring of any virtue
or audacity, except themselves. They rejoice in their own things, they do not love peace. Their
region, as far as the fertility of the soil, the pleasantness of the groves,
the irrigation of rivers and fountains,
the multiplicity of flocks and livestock,
where the shore rejoices in cultivation for
its quantity, nor is it even unequal to the British
soil, as Erodocus says, the most sagacious explorer of the situation of the orb of the lands,
as Pliny recites: inquire above concerning Ireland, I.

About Sweden

Sweden is a region of lower Scythia
in Europe, from which all of Gothia, which
is the largest region among the kingdoms of the Danes and also
the Norici of the northern winds, is named today, having
the Baltic Sea to the east, the British
Ocean to the west, the steep and populous
Noncori to the north, and to the
south it is bounded by the borders of the Dacians.
Sweden, however, which is also called Gothia, is
fruitful as far as the soil is concerned, but without vineyards,
but it recovers other deficiencies in very rich pastures. And in metals:
for besides the riches which that region multiplies from the sea, it surpasses many other regions in wild
animals and livestock, in silver, gold,
and other innumerable things. A very robust people,
whose military power once subdued
almost the entire part of Asia and Europe in many times.
Whom the audacity of the Greeks esteemed to attack in the time of Alexander the Great. Even Julius
Caesar, with his invincible power, having overcome the Gauls,
Allemanni, and Britons, feared to engage with the Dacians
and Goths, Norici, and other northern peoples, as the writers
of history relate, both Greek and
Roman, to whose words faith can and
should be given, in which, as in religious faith, neither reason
can in any way object, as Jerome says.
He says that it is fitting to give faith to the writings and words
of those poets and writers whose relation does not prejudice faith in customs,
nor contradict the truth of the event. From the offspring of these Amazons proceeded, as Oro says, and Ys, li. xiiij.

About Suevia

Suevia is a province of Germanic Renensis
in Europe, whose people
are accustomed to have the greatest dominion
in Germany, as Yb says, li. xiiij.
He also says in the chapter concerning the names of peoples,
li. ix: The Suevi are part of the Germans
in the far north, concerning whom
Lucan also says: He pours forth the blondes from the extreme,
the Suevi from the north, whom
many have believed to have once been villages and
peoples. The Suevi, however, are named from Mount Suevus, which has its origin from the east of Germany,
and they first inhabited the places and borders of that mountain, as Yside says there. Likewise, Vtidem: from the east it has
the Danube with Bavaria, from the west it has
the Rhine with Alsace, from the south it has
the ridge of the Alps with Italy, from the north it has
Franconia, lower Germany.
And there is a double Suevia. The lower extends
against the Rhine, the upper against the Alps
and the Danube. Each is an excellent
and fruitful land, and rich in vineyards in many places,
having very fortified cities, towns,
and castles around the plains and mountains,
rivers and streams, many groves,
grass and pastures of sheep, flocks and herds
around the mountains. It also has iron
and produces silver and metals. A populous people,
militant, strong, bold, and warlike,
tall in body and blond in hair. U. Mcora

About Thrace

Thrace is a province in Greece,
to which Vemens Tiras, son of

Japhet, named Thrace from his own name, as Ys says, li. xiiij; others said that Thrace was named from the fierceness of its inhabitants.
To this, from the east, the city of
Constantinople is opposed; from the north,
Hister extends; from the south,
the sea adheres; from the west,
Macedonia lies beneath. Formerly, diverse
peoples inhabited this region, namely the Massagetae, Sarmatians,
and Scythians, and many other nations.
For it is extensive, and therefore it could contain many nations.
The river Hebrus flows from Thrace, which also touches many barbarous peoples, as di-
ut u h.ximi.

About Thessaly

Thessaly, as Yside says, li. xiiii,
is a province of Greece, named from King Thessalus,
which is connected to Macedonia towards the south.
There are many rivers and
towns in Thessaly, whose capital is called
Thessalonica. There also is Mount Pervasus, once
consecrated to Apollo. Thessaly, however, was
the homeland of Achilles and Ongo Exuus
Iaphitaro, concerning whom it is said that they first
tamed horses with reins, and seemed to be one body
riding on their backs, which is why the centaurs
were feigned for the soldiers of Thessaly, as Ys says, li. xi.m ca. concerning
portents. In Thessaly, solid gold was first
found, and the use of taming horses
was first discovered, as Ys says,
li. xiij. Nd hoc dicit ys.li. inij. quo moysi-
temporibus m thessalia accidit quidedaz

About Etruria

Etruria is a province of Italy, located
between the Ligurians and the territories of the Romans,
which is very strongly fortified with difficult
mountain ridges and very high and steep places.
Etruria, however, as Yb says, li. xiiij, is named from the frequency of sacred rites. For in those
parts, in the obsequies of the dead, they were accustomed to burn and offer ancient incense for the sake of religion and devotion, especially
they lamented and bewailed their dead with lamentable affection; they especially burned incense on the altars of the gods, because, as it is said,
the art of divination was first discovered in Etruria, as Dien Yb says. This was once called Mua,
having many illustrious and noble cities. From the west,
against Liguria, it has the city of Pisa,
Siena, Lucca, Florence,
against the north Vreemvetere,
against the east Arezzo, against the south
Turthonam, Pusium, and Assisi, which are very
despoiled and contiguous to Vieme, having
the Adriatic Sea and the March of Ancona from the east,
the Tiber River and Rome from the south,
Milanese Liguria from the west, and from the north
Romano Lam and the province of Padua.
And this region extends much in
length from east to west, having less
latitude from the northern territory
to the southern. The land, however, is mountainous enough and very strong as far as its situation is concerned,
very fertile as far as the soil is concerned, very healthy
as far as the climate is concerned, which the sea enriches in two places,
which also a multitude of springs and lakes
irrigates and fertilizes.
Rivers flow past and decorate it.
The abundance of aromatic Cretan incense growing there singularly ennobles it.
The abundance of hot springs bubbling up in it gratifies and exalts it.

About Thuringia

Thuringia is a province of middle Germany
between the Saxon people
and the Franks and Westphalians.
For it has Bohemians and Saxons from
the east, Franks and Bavarians from the south,
Suevi and Alsatians from the west,
and Renenses from the north. The people, indeed,
have the name of the fatherland, Thuringia, that is, hard
against enemies, especially severe. For it is a
numerous people, of elegant stature,
strong in body, hard and constant in
mind, having the land almost surrounded and fortified
on all sides by mountains. Within, however,
it is a plain, very fruitful and productive,
not even without vines, having many
towns and strong castles, not only in the mountains,
but also throughout the plain, irrigated by rivers and streams,
very healthy in climate, very pleasing in the freedom of pasture,
very full of herds and flocks. In these
mountains, diverse mineral veins and metals, as Dien Erodocus, which in no way
permit secrets to be hidden in Germany, the best unsearched.

About Touraine

Touraine is a province of Gallia Superioris,
part of Aquitaine,
anciently counted. Named from the Turones,
whose venerable Melita thus called it. In which the most holy Martin, a gem of priests, rests. It is situated upon the river Ligerim, which flows past it and irrigates it and richly enriches it. A fruitful, productive, viniferous, and pasture-rich land, very healthy in climate, wooded. A people robust in body and of elegant form, bold in mind, vigorous in work, modest in speech.

About Gascony

Gascony is a province anciently belonging to Aquitaine,
situated above the Pyrenees, named from Wasce,
as Opicus says, as Xh.li. ix says, having the Pyrenees mountains on one of its sides and the ocean sea on the other. On another, indeed, it approaches the plain of the province of Toulouse.
On another, indeed, it approaches the Pictavian peoples. A wooded and forested land,
salty and mountainous. In many of its
parts it is fertile in vineyards, so that it administers a supply of wine to many regions and islands. The river Gethona separates it from Toulouse, which, flowing past Gascony, enters the ocean sea near the metropolis of Bordeaux, the city of the Gascons, as Yb says, li. xi. in the chapter concerning the names of peoples. The Wascei, named from Wacea Opito, inhabit through the ample solitude of the ridge of the Pyrenees mountain, who are also called Wascones, as if Wacerones, with the letter c mutated, whom Pompey, having subdued Spain, hastening to return for the triumph, deposed from the ridges of the Pyrenees and gathered into one town, whence the city received the name Uncon Fenarum, as Dien says, Ys, Pliny, and Herodotus, who recites that the Gascon is light and agile in body, bold in spirit, precipitous and fierce in battles.

About Venice

Venice was called Venetia from of old, a province which, from the shore of the Adriatic Sea, in whose gulf the city of Venice is now situated, extends as far as the river Po, which divides between the cities and borders of upper Liguria and lower, namely between the Paganenses and the Mediolanenses, as the most truthful relator of Lombard and Ligurian history narrates. Indeed, it now holds many noble cities. Ram Vr says, Yfid: li. xvi, Mamma, who is the daughter of Amanto Cirisie, who, after the intent of Thebanus, was founded in Italy, called Umtheba, situated in Venice, which is called Galliatis Alpina. Venice, therefore, is a province of Italy which has had dominion over many lands and cities from ancient times by sea and by land, whose power today extends through the longest stretches of the sea and even into Greece, touches the borders of the Germans as far as Aquilegia, represses and restrains the Dalmatian and Sclavonian piracy, most justly rules the islands and ports, promontories of the sea and gulfs under their dominion, protects the subjects from enemies especially and defends the republic and subjects the civil to just laws, does not dissimulate or permit any sect contrary to divine institutions to remain within its borders.

It would be superfluous to relate the individual probities of this people, since the virtue and power, circumspection and providence, unity of citizens, concord, love of all justice with clemency, of the Venetian race is now known to almost all nations, as the same royal writer of the history of the Lombards says.

About Westphalia

Westphalia is a province of lower Germany, having Saxony from the east, Thuringia and Hesse from the south, the Rhine and Cologne to the west, the ocean and Frisia to the north. It is girded by two very noble rivers on its extremities, namely the Weser and the Rhine. For the Rhine touches it towards the west and north, but the Weser towards the east. This is said in some books to be ancient Saxony, preserving itself pure from all species of fornication, and punishing rapes most strictly, and cultivating honest marriages supremely. Although it was held implicated by pagan superstition until now, as Boniface complained to the king of England. It is a land very wooded, pasture-rich, suitable for feeding flocks and bearing fruits, irrigated by many springs and rivers, famous, namely, for hippia ator rura and many other springs, hills, and mountains, it abounds in metals, fruits, acorns, nuts, and pears, even wild boars, livestock, and cattle, commonly of elegant stature and tall, of comely form and strong in body and bold in mind, it has a copious and wonderfully spirited militia, prompt to arms continually and prepared. It has strong and fortified cities, very strong castles and towns, both in the mountains and in the plains.

About Wuiroma

Wuiroma is a small province
beyond Dacia towards the east,
named from Virore, because it is grassy
and wooded, irrigated by many waters and springs, whose soil is fertile in grains.

A people once barbarous, savage, un-
couth, and uncultured, but now it is equally subject to the kings and laws of the Danes.
The whole land, however, is inhabited equally by Germans and Danes: inquire above in the letter R.

About Rialia

This land is separated from the Nogardore
people and the Catheori by the largest river, which is called Narve.

About Umlandia

Umlandia is a country situated near the mountains of Norway towards the east,
extended upon the shore of the ocean, not very
fertile except in grasses and woods.
Its people are barbarous, rustic, and savage,
occupied with magical arts. Whence also
to those navigating along their shores or waiting near them
for lack of wind, they offer and
sell a saleable wind. They make a globe of thread and, connecting diverse knots in it, they command up to three knots or more to be drawn out of the globe, so that they may have a stronger wind than they want: by which demons, mocking their foolishness, stir up the air and excite a greater or lesser wind, according as they draw out more or fewer knots from the thread. And since they believe such things, they are justly submerged by the judgment of God.

About Iceland

Selandia is the last region in
Europe, located north beyond
Norway: condemned to perpetual ice in a remote
region around it. However, it extends over the vast ocean
of the sea towards the north, where the sea
freezes with immense force: having Scythia Superior to the east,
Norway to the south, the Hibernian Ocean to the west,
and the frozen sea to the north. And this is called Iceland, as if trapped in ice, because there are said to be huge mountains
of frozen ice there. Crystals are found there. In that region there are also
white bears, very large and fierce, who break the ice with their claws and make holes
through which they plunge into the sea. And catching fish under the ice,
they pull them out through the aforementioned holes and carry them to the shore, where they live. The land
is barren as far as crops are concerned, except in a few
places, in whose valleys barley barely grows: only grass and trees
in the places where men live, they bear
and produce: and in those parts it nourishes wild
animals and livestock. Hence, from fishing
and hunting and meats, for the most part
the people of the land live. Sheep cannot live there because of the cold: and therefore,
careless of the skins of wild animals and weasels which
they capture by hunting, they protect themselves against the cold
and cover their bodies. They cannot have other
garments unless they are brought from elsewhere. The people are very corpulent,
robust, and very white, dedicated to fishing and
hunting.

About Africa

Africa, as some
think, is
called as if
'aprica' because the sun
or sky is pure
and open: close
to the horrors of the cold,
it is subject, as
Isidore says in book XIV. Others think that Africa is
named after Affer, son of Abraham by Keturah,
who is said to have led an army towards Libya,
and having defeated the enemies there, settled,
and named his descendants Africans, as
Isidore says in book IX. Africa begins from the borders
of Egypt, going along the meridian through
Ethiopia to the Atlas Mountains;
to the north, however, it is enclosed by the Mediterranean Sea
and ends in the Strait of Gades.
This is said to be the third part of the world,
divided against Asia and Europe. However, it has
many provinces, such as Libya, Cyrenaica,
Tripoli, Byzacium, Carthage,
Mauretania, and Ethiopia, and many
others. Moreover, that part of the world
which is in Africa is larger in space than Asia or Europe.
But for its size, it is richer
and more wonderful in quality. For it is very rich in
gold and gems, similarly in
crops, fruits, and olives. It also produces
the most wonderful species and figures of beasts and men, as will be clear when
the regions of Africa are described by their names.
It is scorched by the burning heat more than other lands,
and by various sandy shores, barren in countless
sandy heaps, it is made sterile. And it is possessed by
lions, hairy tigers, and other wild beasts. And
as will be clear soon.

About Byzacena

The Byzacena region is in Africa,
consisting of two very noble towns,
Soitita and Weabulum, of which
one is called Andromethe, the other
is called Byzantium. This is fertile in fields
and olives. Its soil is so rich that
seeds sown there almost yield a hundredfold
harvest, as Isidore says in book XIV.

About Dedan

Dedan is a region in Ethiopia,
in the western region, as Isidore says
in book IX, abundant in elephants,
ivory, and wood, as the gloss says on
Ezekiel XVII.

About Egypt

Egypt, which was previously called Aeria, from En Gypto,
Danaus' brother, later, when he reigned there,
took its name. This is bounded by the
Syene and the Red Sea to the east,
it has Libya to the west, the Great Sea to the north,
but to the south it recedes inwards,
extending as far as the Ethiopians, as
Isidore says in book XIV. Moreover, it is a region unused to
rains, ignorant of rainfall. The Nile alone, flowing around it, irrigates it and by its
flooding makes it fertile and fruitful.
Hence, fertile in crops, it nourishes a large
part of the lands with wheat and is so abundant in other commodities that
it fills almost the whole world with necessary merchandise.
The end of Egypt is Canopus, so called from Canopus,
Menelaus' helmsman, buried there. So far Isidore, book XIV.
This was first
called Memphis, named after the daughter of Ham,
as Isidore says in book IX. This region has many
particular provinces and very famous
cities, such as Memphis, built by Epaphus, son
of Jupiter, and Taphnes, the metropolis
of Egypt, Heliopolis, Alexandria, and many
others, as Isidore says in book XVI. In short, Africa is double
Egypt, that is, superior and inferior, which extends
lengthwise. To the north of it is
the Arabian Gulf, to the south the ocean.
From the west, from Egypt, the Syene, which moves
to the east, is bounded by the Red Sea,
containing 23 regions. Moreover, there are many deserts in
Upper Egypt, in which there are many
monsters and monstrous animals: there are
leopards and tigers, there are satyrs and basilisks,
horrible asps and serpents. Moreover, in the borders
of Egypt and Ethiopia, near the source of the Tigris,
the head of a well is believed to be, which the Egyptians
call Phuit. There is a certain serpent of the name Caco,
Hephas, which, although in body
is small and in limbs weak and sluggish,
has a very heavy head, because of
which it always drags it to the surface of the earth, a remedy
which has been provided by nature for the safety
of mortals. It is of such great venom
and destructiveness that no one can
look at it directly in the face without immediately
dying without remedy. For such is the nature
of the serpent which is called a basilisk, as Pliny says
in book VIII, chapter XXII. In Egypt there are very many
crocodiles and hippopotami, that is, river
horses, and especially around the streams of the Nile

About Ethiopia

Ethiopia was first
called from the heat of the people,
whom the sun always
burns, as Isidore says in book XV, from
which the color of men is produced. It is
always hot. Moreover, whatever is under
the meridian axis is mountainous around the west,
but sandy around the middle,
but to the eastern region it is mostly desert.
Its site extends from the foot of the Atlas Mountains
to the east as far as the borders of Egypt,
to the south by the ocean, to the north
it is enclosed by the Nile River. It is full of many
peoples of diverse appearance and monstrous face,
horrible, and also full of a multitude of wild beasts and serpents.
There also the rhinoceros, the chameleon, and the basilisk,
huge dragons, from whose brains
gems are extracted, hyacinths and chrysoprase
and topaz, and other gems are often
found in those parts. And cinnamon is
collected there. Moreover, there are two Ethiopias, one
around the rising sun, the other in Mauretania
around the setting sun, and that is more
neighboring to Spain, then Numidia, then the Carthaginian
province, after this Getulia, and
lastly, against the course of the sun, in the south, is
burnt Ethiopia, beyond which fables say
there are Anupedes, as Isidore says in book XV,
whose words about Ethiopia
are inserted here above. He also says in book IX:
The Ethiopians are named after the son of Cush,
from whom they derive their origin. Cush in the Hebrew
language is called Ethiopia. These, once rising from
the Nile River, settled near Egypt
between the Nile and the ocean in the south,
under the vicinity of the sun, whose
neighbors are peoples such as the Hesperians, on the western side,
the Garamantes, and the Troglodytes, and others
about whom Pliny narrates in book V, chapter X.
The Ethiopian peoples are named after a certain black river,
which river is similar in nature to the Nile.
For it produces similar reeds and
papyrus. At the same time as it freezes,
monstrous men thrive in its deserts.
For some always look at the rising and setting sun
with dire imprecation and curse,
wherefore they continually curse the sun
because of its heat, which burns them greatly.
Others, like Troglodytes, dig caves and
inhabit them instead of houses. They eat serpents
and everything that can be eaten, whose
drink is a hiss, which is their voice. Others, like
cattle, are without marriage,
living with women everywhere without law.
Others walk around naked and not occupied
with any exercise, and they are called Graphasantes.
There are also those who are called Blemmyae, said not to have a head,
but to have their mouth and eyes attached and
fixed to their chest. There are also satyrs, who, having only a human figure,
are similar in morals
