“In the minds of medieval European monks, India was not just a distant land—it was a realm of wonder, wealth, and mystery, stretching eastward beyond the known world. A place where nature and the miraculous intertwined."
"The Rudimentum describes the region as a vast and fertile, encircled on its western edge by the mighty Indus River. It extended to the sunrise in the east and reached northward to the Mountains, which they thought of as the Caucasus Mountains, and nearby was found an island famed for its gems and elephants, Taprobane, which we know nowadays as Sri Lanka. 
“The land of India would bore forests where leaves never fell, and rivers like the Ganges and Hypanis that, according to monks, 'illuminated the region. It was portrayed as a land of abundance—crops grew twice a year, and the air itself was deemed healthy and life-giving. From there would come cinnamon, pepper, aromatic calamus, and ebony. Elephants roamed the forests, birds chirped in the trees, and even unicorns were believed to graze the fields."
"The wealth of the region was legendary. Monks wrote of beryls, diamonds, pearls, and carbuncles—stones so dazzling, they said, they fueled the ambition of noble women across Europe."
"But India's allure wasn't just material. It was mystical—otherworldly. Pliny the Elder and medieval authors spoke of golden mountains guarded by dragons, griffins and all kinds of human monsters. Of tribes with backward-facing feet and eight toes or of more than 120’000 men with dog-heads who did not speak but barked instead.”
"The monks also admired India’s spiritual wisdom. They wrote of the gymnosophists—naked philosophers who stood motionless from sunrise to sunset in burning sands, their eyes fixed on the sun, seeking enlightenment."
"Powerful kings ruled this land, some commanding armies of hundreds of thousands and legions of war elephants. These accounts painted a picture of India not just as a spiritual haven, but as a formidable force of global strength."
"To the medieval monk, India was not just a place—it was a symbol. A canvas onto which awe, curiosity, ignorance, and longing for the exotic were projected. It was both the edge of the world and the center of wonder."
